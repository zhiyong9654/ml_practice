Now the cattle, so fair\\r\\nand goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore, drove in\\r\\nthe best of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers, and using\\r\\nyoung oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When\\r\\nthey had done praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they\\r\\ncut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some\\r\\npieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make\\r\\ndrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring\\r\\non a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;\\r\\nthen, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,\\r\\nthey cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to\\r\\nthe sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so I groaned out\\r\\na prayer to the immortal gods. ‘Father Jove,’ I exclaimed, ‘and all you other\\r\\ngods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me a cruel mischief by the\\r\\nsleep into which you have sent me; see what fine work these men of mine have\\r\\nbeen making in my absence.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been\\r\\nkilling his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said to the immortals,\\r\\n‘Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must have\\r\\nvengeance on the crew of Ulysses’ ship: they have had the insolence to kill my\\r\\ncows, which were the one thing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up\\r\\nheaven or down again.

And indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us,\\r\\nfor the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the joints upon the spits began\\r\\nto low like cows, and the meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise\\r\\njust as cows do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them, but\\r\\nwhen Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury of the gale\\r\\nabated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread sail, and put out\\r\\nto sea. As soon as we were well away from the island, and could see nothing but\\r\\nsky and sea, the son of Saturn raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea\\r\\ngrew dark beneath it. We did not get on much further, for in another moment we\\r\\nwere caught by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of\\r\\nthe mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship’s gear tumbled about at the\\r\\nbottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship’s\\r\\nstern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\\r\\noverboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and round,\\r\\nand was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men all\\r\\nfell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship, looking\\r\\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of\\r\\ngetting home again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which\\r\\ndrifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction of the\\r\\nkeel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and\\r\\nwith this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them was\\r\\ncarried wherever the winds chose to take me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into the\\r\\nSouth again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the terrible\\r\\nwhirlpool of Charybdis.

She was then sucking down the salt sea water,[106] but I was\\r\\ncarried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like\\r\\na bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the\\r\\nroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were\\r\\ntoo high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently\\r\\non, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again—and a very\\r\\nlong while it seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to get home to supper, after\\r\\nhaving been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my\\r\\nraft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go\\r\\nwith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to\\r\\nwhich I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of\\r\\ngods and men would not let her get further sight of me—otherwise I should have\\r\\ncertainly been lost.[107]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the gods\\r\\nstranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and powerful goddess\\r\\nCalypso.

There can be no doubt that the Odyssean\\r\\n line was suggested by the Iliadic, but nothing can explain why Idæus jumping\\r\\n from his chariot should suggest to the writer of the “Odyssey” the sun jumping\\r\\n from the sea. The probability is that she never gave the matter a thought, but\\r\\n took the line in question as an effect of saturation with the “Iliad,” and of\\r\\n unconscious cerebration.

When I rode across the\\r\\n Troad from the Dardanelles to Hissarlik and Mount Ida, I noticed that my\\r\\n dragoman and his men did all our outdoor cooking exactly in the Odyssean and\\r\\n Iliadic fashion.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[27]\\r\\n [ cf. “Il.” xvii. 567. {Greek} The Odyssean lines are—{Greek}]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[28]\\r\\n [ Reading {Greek} for {Greek}, cf. “Od.” i. 186.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29[]\\r\\n [ The geography of the Ægean as above described is correct, but is probably\\r\\n taken from the lost poem, the Nosti, the existence of which is referred to\\r\\n “Od.” i. 326, 327 and 350, &c.

The fact that in the “Iliad” Menelaus came to a banquet\\r\\n without waiting for an invitation, determines the writer of the “Odyssey” to\\r\\n make him come to a banquet, also uninvited, but as circumstances did not\\r\\n permit of his having been invited, his coming uninvited is shown to have been\\r\\n due to chance. I do not think the authoress thought all this out, but\\r\\n attribute the strangeness of the coincidence to unconscious cerebration and\\r\\n saturation.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[32]\\r\\n [ cf. “Il.” I. 458, II. 421. The writer here interrupts an Iliadic passage (to\\r\\n which she returns immediately) for the double purpose of dwelling upon the\\r\\n slaughter of the heifer, and of letting Nestor’s wife and daughter enjoy it\\r\\n also. A male writer, if he was borrowing from the “Iliad,” would have stuck to\\r\\n his borrowing.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[33]\\r\\n [ cf. “Il.” xxiv. 587, 588 where the lines refer to the washing the dead body\\r\\n of Hector.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[34]\\r\\n [ See illustration on opposite page.

The Odyssean {Greek}\\r\\n were the sheds that ran round the yard as the arches do now. The {Greek} was\\r\\n the one through which the main entrance passed, and which was hence “noisy,”\\r\\n or reverberating.

There is no further sign of any special\\r\\n festivities nor of any other guests than Telemachus and Pisistratus, until\\r\\n lines 621-624 (ordinarily enclosed in brackets) are abruptly introduced,\\r\\n probably with a view of trying to carry off the introduction of the lines now\\r\\n in question.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe addition was, I imagine, suggested by a desire to excuse and explain the\\r\\nnon-appearance of Hermione in bk. xv., as also of both Hermione and Megapenthes\\r\\nin the rest of bk. iv. Megapenthes in bk. xv. seems to be still a bachelor: the\\r\\npresumption therefore is that bk. xv. was written before the story of his\\r\\nmarriage here given.

All deaths are bad enough but there is none so bad\\r\\nas famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these cows and offer them in\\r\\nsacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a\\r\\nfine temple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,\\r\\nhowever, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these horned\\r\\ncattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink\\r\\nsalt water once for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by\\r\\ninches in such a desert island as this is.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle, so fair\\r\\nand goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore, drove in\\r\\nthe best of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers, and using\\r\\nyoung oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When\\r\\nthey had done praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they\\r\\ncut out the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some\\r\\npieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make\\r\\ndrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring\\r\\non a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;\\r\\nthen, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,\\r\\nthey cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to\\r\\nthe sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so I groaned out\\r\\na prayer to the immortal gods. ‘Father Jove,’ I exclaimed, ‘and all you other\\r\\ngods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me a cruel mischief by the\\r\\nsleep into which you have sent me; see what fine work these men of mine have\\r\\nbeen making in my absence.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been\\r\\nkilling his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said to the immortals,\\r\\n‘Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must have\\r\\nvengeance on the crew of Ulysses’ ship: they have had the insolence to kill my\\r\\ncows, which were the one thing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up\\r\\nheaven or down again. If they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I\\r\\nwill go down to Hades and shine there among the dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sun,’ said Jove, ‘go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the\\r\\nfruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a bolt of\\r\\nwhite lightning as soon as they get out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the mouth of\\r\\nMercury.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each one of\\r\\nthe men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for the cows were dead\\r\\nalready. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us,\\r\\nfor the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the joints upon the spits began\\r\\nto low like cows, and the meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise\\r\\njust as cows do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them, but\\r\\nwhen Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury of the gale\\r\\nabated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread sail, and put out\\r\\nto sea. As soon as we were well away from the island, and could see nothing but\\r\\nsky and sea, the son of Saturn raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea\\r\\ngrew dark beneath it. We did not get on much further, for in another moment we\\r\\nwere caught by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of\\r\\nthe mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship’s gear tumbled about at the\\r\\nbottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the ship’s\\r\\nstern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\\r\\noverboard as though he were diving, with no more life left in him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and round,\\r\\nand was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men all\\r\\nfell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship, looking\\r\\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of\\r\\ngetting home again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel (which\\r\\ndrifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the direction of the\\r\\nkeel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and\\r\\nwith this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them was\\r\\ncarried wherever the winds chose to take me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into the\\r\\nSouth again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the terrible\\r\\nwhirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, for I was borne\\r\\nalong by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached the rock of Scylla,\\r\\nand the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea water,[106] but I was\\r\\ncarried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like\\r\\na bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the\\r\\nroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were\\r\\ntoo high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently\\r\\non, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again—and a very\\r\\nlong while it seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to get home to supper, after\\r\\nhaving been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my\\r\\nraft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go\\r\\nwith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to\\r\\nwhich I then got, and began to row with my hands.

There are also comments on the geography and topography of ancient Greece, as well as the author's interpretation of certain events and characters in the story.\\n\\nSome of the notes appear to be critical or analytical in nature, while others seem to be more speculative or interpretive. The author's writing style is often conversational and informal, suggesting that these notes may have been written for a private audience or as part of a scholarly discussion.\\n\\nOverall, this collection of notes provides valuable insights into the Odyssey and its interpretation, offering a unique perspective on the poem's language, themes, and historical context.\\n\\nHere are some specific points that can be gleaned from the notes:\\n\\n* The author suggests that the writer of the Odyssey may have been influenced by unconscious cerebration and saturation with Iliadic passages.\\n* There is debate about the accuracy of certain geographical descriptions in the poem, including the location of Telemachus's journey to Sparta.\\n* The author notes that the depiction of women in the Odyssey is often stereotypical or limited, particularly in relation to Hermione and Megapenthes.\\n* The use of amber as a luxury item in the poem may have been influenced by its availability in ancient Sicily.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the many interesting points that can be gleaned from this collection of notes.\",\n",

Nay,\\r\\nbut even so he saved not his company, though he desired it sore. For through\\r\\nthe blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen\\r\\nof Helios Hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these\\r\\nthings, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\\r\\ndeclare thou even unto us.\\r\\n    Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home, and\\r\\nhad escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for\\r\\nhis homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her\\r\\nhollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when now the year had come\\r\\nin the courses of the seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should\\r\\nreturn home to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among\\r\\nhis own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually\\r\\nagainst godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had\\r\\nnow departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in\\r\\ntwain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where\\r\\nhe rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he\\r\\nmade merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls\\r\\nof Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak,\\r\\nfor he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of\\r\\nAgamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the\\r\\nImmortals:\\r\\n    ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say\\r\\ncomes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own\\r\\nhearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\\r\\nbeyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of\\r\\nAtreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his\\r\\neyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\\r\\nslayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the\\r\\nson of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come\\r\\nto man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed\\r\\nnot on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one\\r\\nprice for all.’\\r\\n    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our\\r\\nfather Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death\\r\\nthat is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is\\r\\nrent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long\\r\\nwhile suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a\\r\\nwoodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\\r\\nwizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall\\r\\npillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the\\r\\nhapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him\\r\\nto forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the\\r\\nsmoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\\r\\nheart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of\\r\\nthe Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land?\\r\\nWherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\\r\\n“Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\\r\\nmarginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this end in my MS. I\\r\\nfound, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly scholasticised,\\r\\nand abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on those who have the\\r\\nmanagement of our University presses, that they would render a great service to\\r\\nstudents if they would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic\\r\\npassages printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have\\r\\ngiven the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages\\r\\nunderlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked with all\\r\\nthe Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of both the “Iliad” and\\r\\n“Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAny one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round\\r\\nthe “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his reader’s mind\\r\\nthat the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood, and\\r\\nhence (even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion) presumably by one\\r\\nperson only—that it was written certainly before 750, and in all probability\\r\\nbefore 1000 B.C.—that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably\\r\\nfamiliar with the “Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those\\r\\nbooks whose genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are\\r\\nadmitted to be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his\\r\\nreaders, is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who\\r\\nwill mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British Museum\\r\\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common sense can\\r\\ndraw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems, will, I\\r\\nbelieve, find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number\\r\\nof books here and on the Continent that at present enjoy considerable\\r\\nreputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps is an advantage better worth\\r\\nsecuring, he will find that many puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him\\r\\non the discovery that they arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOther difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the poem\\r\\nin the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some length in\\r\\npp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly, the “Odyssey” consists\\r\\nof two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked\\r\\nto sing in the opening lines of the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian\\r\\nepisode, and the account of Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books\\r\\nix.-xii. It consists of lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v.,\\r\\nand thence without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at\\r\\nwhich point the original scheme was abandoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of Telemachus’\\r\\nvoyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of Book i., is\\r\\ncontinued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till Ulysses wakes in the\\r\\nmiddle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it continues to the end of Book\\r\\nxxiv.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on\\r\\nand on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When\\r\\nthey were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,\\r\\nbeating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that\\r\\nwere below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off\\r\\ntowards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and\\r\\nasked each other what all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\\r\\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all\\r\\nhonesty, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I\\r\\nsee mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away much longer;\\r\\nindeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them\\r\\nalone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in\\r\\ntime, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so\\r\\nof their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying\\r\\nwithout due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when\\r\\nthe Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through\\r\\nmuch hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\\r\\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to your\\r\\nown children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much\\r\\nbetter than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or\\r\\nother, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in a far country, and it\\r\\nis a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens\\r\\nand adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I\\r\\nsuppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell\\r\\nyou—and it shall surely be—when an old man like you, who should know better,\\r\\ntalks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his\\r\\nyoung friend will only fare so much the worse—he will take nothing by it, for\\r\\nthe suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir,\\r\\nupon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon\\r\\nyou. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his\\r\\nmother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all\\r\\nthe marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on\\r\\nharassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with\\r\\nall his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as\\r\\nmuch as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and\\r\\ncontinue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till such time as\\r\\nhis mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe\\r\\nof expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare\\r\\nperfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\\r\\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more,\\r\\nand entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my\\r\\nstory. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and\\r\\nthither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so\\r\\nlong been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear\\r\\nthings in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of\\r\\nhim as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\\r\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I\\r\\nwill return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\\r\\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor[20] who had been a friend of Ulysses, and\\r\\nhad been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants,\\r\\nrose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\\r\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I hope\\r\\nthat all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one\\r\\nof you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father.\\r\\nI am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in\\r\\nthe naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not\\r\\nreturn, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you\\r\\nothers I am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying\\r\\nto stop such scandalous goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you are\\r\\nmany and they are few.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is all\\r\\nthis, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man\\r\\nto fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set\\r\\nupon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his\\r\\nwife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing,\\r\\nand his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds.\\r\\nThere is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people\\r\\ngo about your business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and\\r\\nHalitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I do not\\r\\nthink he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\\r\\nand tells him something.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode,\\r\\nwhile the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey\\r\\nwaves, and prayed to Minerva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the\\r\\nseas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but\\r\\nthe Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I\\r\\ncannot do so.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the\\r\\nvoice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of the same stuff as\\r\\nyour father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never\\r\\nbroke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your\\r\\nvoyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of\\r\\nPenelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom\\r\\nas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\\r\\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not\\r\\nentirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look with hope\\r\\nupon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those\\r\\nfoolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to\\r\\ndeath and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that\\r\\nthey shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long\\r\\ndelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a\\r\\nship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\\r\\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see\\r\\neverything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the\\r\\nstaff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up\\r\\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run\\r\\nmy eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and\\r\\nwill put out to sea without delay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as\\r\\nthe goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the suitors flaying goats\\r\\nand singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once and\\r\\nlaughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, “Telemachus, my fine\\r\\nfire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink\\r\\nwith us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and\\r\\na picked crew to boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news\\r\\nof your noble father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of\\r\\nany kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so\\r\\nmuch good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know\\r\\nmore about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by\\r\\ngoing to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will\\r\\nnot be in vain—though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of\\r\\nmy own, and must be passenger not captain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others\\r\\nwent on getting dinner ready about the buildings,[21] jeering at him tauntingly as they did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I suppose he\\r\\nthinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where\\r\\nhe seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in\\r\\nour wine and kill us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his\\r\\nfather and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to\\r\\ndo, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we\\r\\ncan let his mother and the man who marries her have that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious\\r\\nstore-room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon\\r\\nthe floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests.\\r\\nHere, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old,\\r\\nwell-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against\\r\\nthe wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all. The room was closed\\r\\nwith well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old\\r\\nhouse-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of\\r\\neverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping\\r\\nfor my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and\\r\\nfind his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they\\r\\nall have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal—about\\r\\ntwenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing\\r\\nabout it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has\\r\\ngone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can\\r\\nhear anything about the return of my dear father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, “My\\r\\ndear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in\\r\\nthe world do you want to go to—you, who are the one hope of the house? Your\\r\\npoor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as\\r\\nsoon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you\\r\\nput out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay\\r\\nwhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your\\r\\nlife out on the barren ocean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without heaven’s\\r\\nsanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till\\r\\nI have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone,\\r\\nand asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had\\r\\ncompleted her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the\\r\\nbarley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went\\r\\nround the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by\\r\\nsundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let her have\\r\\na ship—which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was\\r\\nover all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board\\r\\nher that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour.\\r\\nPresently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep\\r\\nslumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups\\r\\nfrom their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back\\r\\ninto the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she\\r\\ntook the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for\\r\\nyou to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\\r\\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus by the\\r\\nhand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going to be a great hero some\\r\\nday, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can\\r\\nhave been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable\\r\\ndaughter, the Trito-born, who shewed such favour towards your brave father\\r\\namong the Argives. Holy queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace\\r\\nupon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in\\r\\nsacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\\r\\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in\\r\\nsacrifice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own\\r\\nhouse, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got there and had\\r\\ntaken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine\\r\\nthat was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that\\r\\nheld it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to\\r\\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink\\r\\nofferings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to\\r\\nbed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that\\r\\nwas over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now\\r\\nleft him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\\r\\nqueen his wife by his side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left his\\r\\ncouch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood\\r\\nin front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but\\r\\nhe was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat\\r\\nsceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their\\r\\nrooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and\\r\\nThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them\\r\\nthey made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and\\r\\nforemost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested herself\\r\\nvisibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to\\r\\nthe plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it\\r\\nat once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship, and invite all the crew, leaving\\r\\ntwo men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus\\r\\nthe goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where\\r\\nyou are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to\\r\\nfetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me\\r\\nsome clear spring water.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in\\r\\nfrom the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought\\r\\nthe anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva\\r\\nherself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith\\r\\ngilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their\\r\\nbeauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched\\r\\nwater from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his\\r\\nother hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\\r\\nsharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor\\r\\nbegan with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered\\r\\nmany a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer’s head upon the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal[32] Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and\\r\\nbrought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base\\r\\nof her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his\\r\\nvenerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\\r\\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer’s head from off the ground, and\\r\\nPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they\\r\\ncut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round\\r\\nin two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then\\r\\nNestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young\\r\\nmen stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were\\r\\nburned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up\\r\\nsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When\\r\\nshe had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and\\r\\nshirt,[33] and he\\r\\nlooked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of\\r\\nNestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat\\r\\ndown to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\\r\\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to\\r\\neat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to the chariot that\\r\\nhe may start at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses\\r\\nto the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and\\r\\nsweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot,\\r\\nwhile Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed\\r\\nthe horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving\\r\\nthe high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying\\r\\nthe yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\r\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\\r\\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they\\r\\nagain yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\\r\\ngatehouse.[34]\\r\\nPisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently\\r\\nthey came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time\\r\\ncompleted their journey, so well did their steeds take them.[35]\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK IV\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY—MEANWHILE THE SUITORS IN ITHACA\\r\\nPLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who have come\\r\\nto visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help saying what I\\r\\nthink. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed\\r\\nwhen I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like\\r\\nTelemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to\\r\\nTroy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do. His hands\\r\\nand feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape of his head and\\r\\nthe expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses, and\\r\\nsaying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he\\r\\nhid his face in his mantle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that\\r\\nthis young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come\\r\\nhere and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely\\r\\ninteresting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for\\r\\nhe wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son\\r\\nhas always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without\\r\\nsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\\r\\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from the son\\r\\nof a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake. I had always\\r\\nhoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us\\r\\na safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in\\r\\nArgos, and built him a house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his\\r\\ngoods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of\\r\\nthe neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one\\r\\nanother continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and\\r\\nhappy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\\r\\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept, Telemachus\\r\\nwept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his eyes from filling,\\r\\nwhen he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom the son of bright Dawn had\\r\\nkilled. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you\\r\\nwere a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do\\r\\nas I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper.\\r\\nMorning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry\\r\\nfor those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We\\r\\ncan only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a\\r\\nbrother who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\\r\\nto have known him—his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself,\\r\\nbut they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years. It is\\r\\nplain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one\\r\\nwhom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring—and it has blessed\\r\\nNestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own\\r\\nhouse, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put\\r\\nan end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water\\r\\nbe poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\\r\\nthe morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they\\r\\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the\\r\\nwine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever\\r\\ndrinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not\\r\\neven though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a\\r\\nbrother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of such\\r\\nsovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon,\\r\\na woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into\\r\\nthe mixing bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country\\r\\nis a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put\\r\\nthis drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable men\\r\\n(which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do\\r\\nwhat he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in\\r\\nseason. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I\\r\\ncan say what he did when he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts\\r\\nof difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself\\r\\nall in rags, and entered the enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar,\\r\\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people. In this\\r\\ndisguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\\r\\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When,\\r\\nhowever, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I\\r\\nhad sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely\\r\\nback to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant\\r\\nto do. He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\\r\\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my\\r\\nown part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I\\r\\nwas unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,\\r\\naway from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by\\r\\nno means deficient either in person or understanding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I\\r\\nhave travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I have never seen\\r\\nsuch another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and what courage he displayed\\r\\nwithin the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in\\r\\nwait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.[43] At that moment you came up to us;\\r\\nsome god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\\r\\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat\\r\\nit; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our\\r\\nwives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made.\\r\\nDiomed and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there,\\r\\nor to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite\\r\\nstill, all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses\\r\\nclapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\\r\\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save him,\\r\\nnor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed,\\r\\nthat we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the\\r\\ngatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top\\r\\nof them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out,\\r\\ncarrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted\\r\\nthe strangers. Thus, then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the\\r\\nforecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by\\r\\nhis side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then,\\r\\ntaking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?\\r\\nAre you on public, or private business? Tell me all about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me anything\\r\\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is\\r\\nbeing wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers\\r\\nof my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother.\\r\\nTherefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my\\r\\nfather’s melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it\\r\\nfrom some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften\\r\\nthings out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\\r\\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\\r\\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as\\r\\nin my favour and tell me truly all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed, “these\\r\\ncowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay her new born\\r\\nyoung in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some\\r\\ngrassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with\\r\\nthe pair of them—and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove,\\r\\nMinerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled\\r\\nwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans\\r\\ncheered him—if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would\\r\\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I\\r\\nwill not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\\r\\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my\\r\\nhecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict\\r\\nabout having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a\\r\\nday with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos—it\\r\\nhas a good harbour from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have\\r\\ntaken in water—and here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a\\r\\nbreath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of\\r\\nprovisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon\\r\\nme and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of\\r\\nthe sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used\\r\\nto go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of catching a\\r\\nfish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. ‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it\\r\\nseems to me that you like starving in this way—at any rate it does not greatly\\r\\ntrouble you, for you stick here day after day, without even trying to get away\\r\\nthough your men are dying by inches.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be,\\r\\nthat I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods\\r\\nthat live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything, which of\\r\\nthe immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I\\r\\nmay sail the sea so as to reach my home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an\\r\\nold immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is Proteus. He\\r\\nis an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune’s head man and\\r\\nknows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him\\r\\nand hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to\\r\\ntake, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also\\r\\ntell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both good\\r\\nand bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may catch this\\r\\nold god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a god is not easily\\r\\ncaught—not by a mortal man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time\\r\\nwhen the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea comes up\\r\\nfrom under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water over his\\r\\nhead. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to sleep in a great sea\\r\\ncave, where the seals—Halosydne’s chickens as they call them—come up also from\\r\\nthe grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and\\r\\nfish-like smell do they bring with them. [44] Early to-morrow morning I will take\\r\\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three\\r\\nbest men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the\\r\\nold man will play you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen\\r\\nthem and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them, as a\\r\\nshepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep seize him; put\\r\\nforth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to\\r\\nget away from you. He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes\\r\\nupon the earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him\\r\\nfast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes\\r\\nback to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your\\r\\nhold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry\\r\\nwith you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place\\r\\nwhere my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care\\r\\nas I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was\\r\\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into\\r\\nthin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid\\r\\nhad been her dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent\\r\\non murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great\\r\\nsize, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either\\r\\nside of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in\\r\\nambush.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK V\\n\\r\\nCALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike\\r\\nto mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord\\r\\nof thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many\\r\\nsufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph\\r\\nCalypso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in everlasting\\r\\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler\\r\\nany more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth\\r\\ncruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten\\r\\nUlysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in\\r\\ngreat pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him\\r\\ngo; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships\\r\\nnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying\\r\\nto murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and\\r\\nLacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you not send\\r\\nhim there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to get home and\\r\\npunish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telemachus, and\\r\\nto see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying\\r\\nback without having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are our\\r\\nmessenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is\\r\\nto return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a\\r\\nperilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria,[50] the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he\\r\\nwere one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and\\r\\nwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back\\r\\nfrom Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\\r\\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was\\r\\ntold. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could\\r\\nfly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s\\r\\neyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand\\r\\nover Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the\\r\\nlevel of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing\\r\\nevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the\\r\\nspray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\\r\\nisland which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he\\r\\ncame to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one\\r\\ncould smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for\\r\\nherself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp\\r\\nand singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder,\\r\\npoplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had\\r\\nbuilt their nests—owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their\\r\\nbusiness in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew\\r\\nluxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\\r\\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so\\r\\nas to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed.\\r\\n[51] Even a god\\r\\ncould not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still\\r\\nand looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the\\r\\ncave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, no matter how far\\r\\nthey live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was on the sea-shore\\r\\nas usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning\\r\\nand breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: “Why\\r\\nhave you come to see me, Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you do not\\r\\nvisit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and\\r\\nif it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him\\r\\nsome red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I have come\\r\\nhere, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove sent me; it was\\r\\nno doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea\\r\\nwhere there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice\\r\\nhecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross\\r\\nJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most\\r\\nill-starred of all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam\\r\\nand sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way home\\r\\nthey sinned against Minerva,[52] who raised both wind and waves\\r\\nagainst them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\\r\\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at\\r\\nonce, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people,\\r\\nbut shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him\\r\\nfrom the island after washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave\\r\\nhim a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also\\r\\ngave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat.\\r\\nMoreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses\\r\\nspread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means\\r\\nof the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on\\r\\nlate-setting Bootes, and on the Bear—which men also call the wain, and which\\r\\nturns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into\\r\\nthe stream of Oceanus—for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days\\r\\nseven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\\r\\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising\\r\\nlike a shield on the horizon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\\r\\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him\\r\\nsailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and\\r\\nmuttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods have been changing\\r\\ntheir minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he is close to\\r\\nthe land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the\\r\\ncalamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet\\r\\nbefore he has done with it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round\\r\\nin the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and\\r\\nsky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from\\r\\nEast, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a\\r\\ntremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart began to fail him. “Alas,” he\\r\\nsaid to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me? I am afraid\\r\\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back\\r\\nhome. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds,\\r\\nand what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe\\r\\nto perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in\\r\\nthe cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when\\r\\nthe Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\\r\\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name;\\r\\nbut now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled\\r\\nagain, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the\\r\\nforce of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and\\r\\nboth sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Ulysses was under\\r\\nwater, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes\\r\\nCalypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\\r\\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In\\r\\nspite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast\\r\\nas he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to\\r\\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\\r\\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the South,\\r\\nNorth, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea, saw\\r\\nhim. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank\\r\\nof a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses now was, she had\\r\\ncompassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat\\r\\nupon the raft.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with you? He\\r\\nis giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill\\r\\nyou. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave your\\r\\nraft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast where better\\r\\nluck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round your chest; it is\\r\\nenchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you\\r\\ntouch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\\r\\ngo away again.” With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then\\r\\nshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in his\\r\\ndismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by\\r\\nadvising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the\\r\\nland where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good\\r\\nway off. I know what I will do—I am sure it will be best—no matter what happens\\r\\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea\\r\\nbreaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that seemed\\r\\nto rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft, which then\\r\\nwent to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a\\r\\nwhirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on\\r\\nhorseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino’s veil\\r\\nunder his arms, and plunged into the sea—meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune\\r\\nwatched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\\r\\n“There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do\\r\\npeople. I do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\\r\\nlightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the winds\\r\\nexcept one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze\\r\\nfrom the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses reached the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians where he would be safe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy\\r\\nswell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day\\r\\nbroke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of\\r\\nair stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see\\r\\nland quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father begins to get\\r\\nbetter after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some\\r\\nangry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when\\r\\nhe again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\\r\\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he\\r\\nbegan to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still\\r\\nbroke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\\r\\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but\\r\\nonly headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\\n---------new doc---------\\nUlysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself,\\r\\n“Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all\\r\\nhope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,\\r\\nthe rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under\\r\\nthem so that I cannot climb out for want of foot hold. I am afraid some great\\r\\nwave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\\r\\nwater—which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim\\r\\nfurther in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me\\r\\nout to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster\\r\\nof the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\\r\\nNeptune is very angry with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force\\r\\nagainst the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Minerva\\r\\nhad not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and\\r\\nclung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that\\r\\ntime; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with it far\\r\\ninto the sea—tearing his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some\\r\\none plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it—even so did\\r\\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep\\r\\ndown under the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\\r\\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam\\r\\nseaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and\\r\\nat the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some\\r\\nhaven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on,\\r\\nhe came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best place,\\r\\nfor there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that\\r\\nthere was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god\\r\\nNeptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost his way has at\\r\\nall times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to\\r\\nyour stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O\\r\\nking, for I declare myself your suppliant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before\\r\\nhim, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Ulysses’\\r\\nknees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him. His\\r\\nbody was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with\\r\\nsea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from\\r\\nsheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to himself\\r\\nagain, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the\\r\\nsalt[54] stream of\\r\\nthe river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it\\r\\ntowards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and\\r\\nkissed the bounteous earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me, and\\r\\nhow is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the long\\r\\nwatches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make\\r\\nan end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the\\r\\nriver. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods,\\r\\nand sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night’s rest,\\r\\nbut some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some\\r\\nhigh ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive\\r\\nthat grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted sucker, while the other had\\r\\nbeen grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they\\r\\nafforded, nor could the sun’s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them,\\r\\nso closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began\\r\\nto make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves\\r\\nlying about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter\\r\\nweather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the\\r\\nleaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any\\r\\nneighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having\\r\\nto get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and\\r\\nMinerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\\r\\nall memories of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VI\\n\\r\\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the\\r\\ncountry and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in the fair town\\r\\nof Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger than\\r\\nthey and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved them thence and settled\\r\\nthem in Scheria, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall,\\r\\nbuilt houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was\\r\\ndead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\\r\\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\\r\\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a\\r\\ngirl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alcinous. Two\\r\\nmaid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side of\\r\\nthe doorway, which was closed with well made folding doors. Minerva took the\\r\\nform of the famous sea captain Dymas’s daughter, who was a bosom friend of\\r\\nNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a\\r\\nbreath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter?\\r\\nHere are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married\\r\\nalmost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should\\r\\nfind good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a\\r\\ngood name, and to make your father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that\\r\\nwe make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you\\r\\nso that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\\r\\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going to\\r\\nremain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and\\r\\nmules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\\r\\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the\\r\\nwashing-cisterns are some way from the town.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is the\\r\\neverlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor\\r\\nsnow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great\\r\\npeacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and\\r\\never. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given\\r\\ninstructions to the girl.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met,\\r\\nand I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let\\r\\nme have anything that you may have brought hither to wrap your clothes in. May\\r\\nheaven grant you in all things your heart’s desire—husband, house, and a happy,\\r\\npeaceful home; for there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife\\r\\nshould be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts\\r\\nof their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\r\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives prosperity to\\r\\nrich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send\\r\\nyou, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our\\r\\ncountry, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner\\r\\nin distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and\\r\\nwill tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am\\r\\ndaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not\\r\\nsee a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a\\r\\nmurderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any\\r\\nharm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land’s end that juts\\r\\ninto the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any other people. This is\\r\\nonly some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for\\r\\nstrangers and foreigners in distress are under Jove’s protection, and will take\\r\\nwhat they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\\r\\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back.\\r\\nThey made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and\\r\\nbrought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of\\r\\noil, and told him to go and wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, “Young women,\\r\\nplease to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine from my\\r\\nshoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has\\r\\nhad a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing\\r\\nthere. I am ashamed to strip[56] before a number of good looking young\\r\\nwomen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses washed\\r\\nhimself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad\\r\\nshoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of\\r\\nhis hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl\\r\\nhad given him; Minerva then made him look taller and stronger than before, she\\r\\nalso made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls\\r\\nlike hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a\\r\\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\\r\\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty.\\r\\nThen he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young\\r\\nand handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her\\r\\nmaids:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in\\r\\nheaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him\\r\\nplain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I\\r\\nshould like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would\\r\\nonly stay here and not want to go away. However, give him something to eat and\\r\\ndrink.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and drank\\r\\nravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile,\\r\\nNausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed\\r\\nin the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called\\r\\nUlysses:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\\r\\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that\\r\\nyou will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I\\r\\nbid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the\\r\\nfields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids\\r\\nand I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the town,\\r\\nwhere you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on\\r\\neither side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\\r\\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You\\r\\nwill see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and\\r\\npaved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship’s gear of\\r\\nall kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars\\r\\nare made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing\\r\\nabout bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their\\r\\nmasts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later\\r\\non; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met\\r\\nus, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with\\r\\nNausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps\\r\\nhe is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we\\r\\nhave no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to\\r\\nher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It\\r\\nwould be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband\\r\\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young\\r\\nPhaeacians who are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark\\r\\nthat would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be\\r\\nscandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in\\r\\nspite of everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\\r\\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you are\\r\\nunskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I suppose\\r\\nyou are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or\\r\\nmerchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward\\r\\ncargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent fellow—so\\r\\ntrue is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and\\r\\nunderstanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this\\r\\nwith such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his\\r\\nhoneyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all\\r\\nassemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may\\r\\nbe as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\\r\\nThis is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but\\r\\nyou are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you\\r\\nare quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\\r\\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.\\r\\nNow, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much\\r\\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite\\r\\nof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger,\\r\\nmore massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when\\r\\ndisc-throwing among themselves.[68] Then, swinging it back, he threw it\\r\\nfrom his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The\\r\\nPhaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from\\r\\nhis hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form\\r\\nof a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,”\\r\\nsaid she, “could easily tell your mark by groping for it—it is so far ahead of\\r\\nany other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can\\r\\ncome near to such a throw as yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he\\r\\nbegan to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to that throw if\\r\\nyou can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone\\r\\nwants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I\\r\\nwill box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all\\r\\nexcept Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot\\r\\ncompete with one’s own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or\\r\\na sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host’s family at any game,\\r\\nespecially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\\r\\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I\\r\\nwant to have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at\\r\\nevery kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In\\r\\nbattle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how\\r\\nmany more are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man\\r\\nwho could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\\r\\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat\\r\\nbread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the\\r\\nmighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men who could shoot\\r\\nagainst the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by\\r\\nhis end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\\r\\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.\\r\\nRunning is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\\r\\nPhaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my\\r\\nprovisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, “Sir, we have had\\r\\nmuch pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand\\r\\nthat you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some\\r\\ninsolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which\\r\\ncould never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety.\\r\\nI hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief\\r\\nmen who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\\r\\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not\\r\\nparticularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are\\r\\nsingularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of\\r\\ngood dinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm\\r\\nbaths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set\\r\\nabout dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his\\r\\nfriends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, and\\r\\nminstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of\\r\\nyou and fetch it for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king’s house, and the\\r\\nnine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business\\r\\nto manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth\\r\\nand marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently the servant came back with\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best\\r\\nyoung dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was\\r\\ndelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how they\\r\\nfirst began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus many\\r\\npresents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who saw what they\\r\\nwere about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful\\r\\nnews, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its\\r\\nplace, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break,\\r\\nso that they might stay there in that place.[69] When he had finished his snare he\\r\\nwent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\\r\\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not\\r\\neven a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had\\r\\nspread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\\r\\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one he was\\r\\nmost fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start,\\r\\nhurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about\\r\\nsitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in\\r\\nhis own, “Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, but is gone off\\r\\nto Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon\\r\\nthey were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for them, and\\r\\ncould neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were\\r\\nin a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching\\r\\nLemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious\\r\\npassion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to\\r\\nall the gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” he cried, “and all you other blessed gods who live for ever,\\r\\ncome here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you.\\r\\nJove’s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am lame. She is in\\r\\nlove with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple—but my\\r\\nparents are to blame for that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me.\\r\\nCome and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at\\r\\nthem. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there\\r\\nlonger than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\\r\\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for\\r\\nhis baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune\\r\\ncame, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses staid\\r\\nat home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in the\\r\\ndoorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they\\r\\nsaw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping\\r\\nVulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god in heaven; and\\r\\nnow Mars will be cast in heavy damages.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, “Messenger Mercury,\\r\\ngiver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you,\\r\\nif you could sleep with Venus?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Apollo,” answered Mercury, “I only wish I might get the chance, though\\r\\nthere were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all of you, gods\\r\\nand goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all\\r\\nseriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again. “Let him go,”\\r\\nhe cried, “and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the\\r\\ndamages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not,” replied Vulcan, “ask me to do this; a bad man’s bond is bad security;\\r\\nwhat remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away and leave his\\r\\ndebts behind him along with his chains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will\\r\\npay you myself.” So Vulcan answered, “In this case I cannot and must not refuse\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they\\r\\nscampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to Cyprus and to\\r\\nPaphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here\\r\\nthe Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the\\r\\nimmortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most\\r\\nenchanting beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed\\r\\nas they heard him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to\\r\\ncompete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and\\r\\none of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while\\r\\nthe other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came\\r\\ndown again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they\\r\\nbegan to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards\\r\\nto one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great\\r\\nstamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world,\\r\\nand indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement; let us\\r\\ngive him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are\\r\\ntwelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,\\r\\neach of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him\\r\\nall this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so\\r\\nwith a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\r\\npresent too, for he has been rude.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their\\r\\nservants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King Alcinous, I will give\\r\\nthe stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have my sword, which is\\r\\nof bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the\\r\\nscabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal\\r\\nto him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good luck to\\r\\nyou, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it\\r\\naway with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you\\r\\nhave been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo which Ulysses answered, “Good luck to you too my friend, and may the gods\\r\\ngrant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me\\r\\nalong with your apology.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown\\r\\nthe presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept\\r\\nbringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons received them, and\\r\\nplaced them under their mother’s charge. Then Alcinous led the way to the house\\r\\nand bade his guests take their seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we have, and\\r\\nput a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some\\r\\nwater; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the\\r\\npresents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy\\r\\nboth his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this\\r\\ngolden goblet—which is of exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me\\r\\nfor the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any\\r\\nof the gods.”[70]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they\\r\\ncould, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they\\r\\nthrew on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\\r\\nabout the belly of the tripod.[71] Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent\\r\\nchest from her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of\\r\\ngold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and\\r\\na good shirt from Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:\\n---------new doc---------\\n“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His\\r\\ngreat neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.\\r\\nPresently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh\\r\\non which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of\\r\\nwood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them\\r\\nshould turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to\\r\\nblaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round\\r\\nme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of\\r\\nthe beam into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept\\r\\nturning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s plank\\r\\nwith an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\\r\\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the\\r\\nboiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the\\r\\nsteam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots\\r\\nof the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\\r\\ninto cold water to temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and\\r\\nit makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round\\r\\nthe beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran\\r\\naway in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his\\r\\neye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so\\r\\nto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they\\r\\ngathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\\r\\nwhat was the matter with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking\\r\\nthe stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely\\r\\nno man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either\\r\\nby fraud or by force?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing me by\\r\\nfraud; no man is killing me by force.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove\\r\\nmakes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your\\r\\nfather Neptune.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\\r\\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with\\r\\nhis hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the\\r\\ndoorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with\\r\\nthe sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life\\r\\nand those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his\\r\\nlife depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nthis plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown, and carried a\\r\\nheavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some\\r\\nof the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man\\r\\nunder the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\\r\\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than\\r\\nany of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the\\r\\nthick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards,\\r\\nkeeping a firm hold on it all the time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to\\r\\nfeed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for\\r\\ntheir udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain\\r\\nfelt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp\\r\\nenough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was\\r\\ngoing out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\\r\\nself, Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\\r\\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with\\r\\na run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come\\r\\nhome again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your\\r\\nmaster has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid\\r\\ncrew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life\\r\\nyet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is\\r\\nhiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the\\r\\ncave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has\\r\\ndone me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from\\r\\nthe cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly, and then freed my\\r\\ncomrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in\\r\\nthe right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew\\r\\nrejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the\\r\\nothers whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding\\r\\nand frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\\r\\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their\\r\\nplaces, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out\\r\\nas my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man before\\r\\neating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your visitors in your\\r\\nown house? You might have known that your sin would find you out, and now Jove\\r\\nand the other gods have punished you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a\\r\\nhigh mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a\\r\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder.[81] The sea quaked as the rock fell into\\r\\nit, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland,\\r\\nand forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the\\r\\nship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for\\r\\ntheir lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as\\r\\nwe were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and\\r\\nprayed of me to hold my tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\\r\\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the\\r\\nmainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard\\r\\nany further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship’s\\r\\ntimbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he\\r\\ncan throw them a long way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, ‘Cyclops,\\r\\nif any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty,\\r\\nsay it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncovered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought\\r\\nher by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’\\r\\nsaid I, ‘please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my\\r\\nhomeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering\\r\\nme with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the goddess answered, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of\\r\\nyou stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey\\r\\nwhich you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the ghost of the blind Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, whose reason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine\\r\\nleft his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about\\r\\naimlessly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly\\r\\nhave lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was\\r\\ntired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon\\r\\nthis voyage—for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise your mast, set your white\\r\\nsails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of itself. When\\r\\nyour ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore\\r\\nof Proserpine’s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed\\r\\ntheir fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go\\r\\nstraight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where\\r\\nthe rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)\\r\\nflow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring\\r\\nrivers run into one another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or\\r\\nso in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all\\r\\nthe dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place\\r\\nwater—sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many\\r\\nprayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to\\r\\nIthaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will\\r\\nload the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\\r\\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your\\r\\nflocks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a\\r\\nram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away\\r\\nfrom them as though you would make towards the river. On this, many dead men’s\\r\\nghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that\\r\\nyou have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades\\r\\nand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any\\r\\nother poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have\\r\\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you\\r\\nabout your voyage—what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea\\r\\nso as to reach your home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my\\r\\nshirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric\\r\\nover her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she\\r\\ncovered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men everywhere all\\r\\nover the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man by man: ‘You must not lie\\r\\nsleeping here any longer,’ said I to them, ‘we must be going, for Circe has\\r\\ntold me all about it.’ And on this they did as I bade them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had with us\\r\\na certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who\\r\\nhad got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to\\r\\nsleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men bustling\\r\\nabout, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main\\r\\nstaircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul\\r\\nwent down to the house of Hades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had got the men together I said to them, ‘You think you are about to\\r\\nstart home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have\\r\\ngot to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the\\r\\nground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by\\r\\ncrying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe\\r\\nbrought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She passed\\r\\nthrough the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and\\r\\ngoings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XI\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO THE DEAD.[88]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water\\r\\nand got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took\\r\\nour places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and\\r\\ncunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with\\r\\nus keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing\\r\\nto the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day\\r\\nlong her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of\\r\\nthe river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\\r\\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither\\r\\nat his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor\\r\\nwretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the\\r\\nship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till\\r\\nwe came to the place of which Circe had told us.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug\\r\\nthe trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first\\r\\nwith honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled\\r\\nwhite barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless\\r\\nghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a\\r\\nbarren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good\\r\\nthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep\\r\\nto himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the\\r\\ndead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench,\\r\\nwhereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus—brides,[89] young bachelors, old men worn out\\r\\nwith toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been\\r\\nkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from\\r\\nevery quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming\\r\\nsound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men\\r\\nto be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt\\r\\nofferings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to\\r\\nProserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the\\r\\npoor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet\\r\\nbeen laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and unburied in\\r\\nCirce’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for him,\\r\\nand cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how did you come down here into\\r\\nthis gloom and darkness? You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my\\r\\nship.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable\\r\\ndrunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s house, and never thought\\r\\nof coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof and\\r\\nbroke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech\\r\\nyou by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by\\r\\nyour wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child, and by\\r\\nTelemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I\\r\\nknow that when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the\\r\\nAeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or\\r\\nI may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have,\\r\\nbuild a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\\r\\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row\\r\\nwith when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’ And I said, ‘My poor fellow,\\r\\nI will do all that you have asked of me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side\\r\\nof the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade\\r\\nsaying all this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost of my dead\\r\\nmother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her alive when I set out for\\r\\nTroy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I\\r\\nwould not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of\\r\\nTeiresias.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre in his\\r\\nhand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have\\r\\nyou left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?\\r\\nStand back from the trench and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the\\r\\nblood and answer your questions truly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood\\r\\nhe began with his prophecy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will make\\r\\nthis hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of Neptune, who\\r\\nstill nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son. Still,\\r\\nafter much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your\\r\\ncompanions when your ship reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find\\r\\nthe sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of\\r\\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm\\r\\nthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\\r\\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing\\r\\nall your men, [in another man’s ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\\r\\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your substance\\r\\nunder the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and after you\\r\\nhave killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must take a well made\\r\\noar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where the people have\\r\\nnever heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food, nor do they\\r\\nknow anything about ships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will\\r\\ngive you this certain token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will\\r\\nmeet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\\r\\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a\\r\\nbull, and a boar to Neptune.[90] Then go home and offer hecatombs to\\r\\nall the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come\\r\\nto you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\\r\\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I have\\r\\nsaid will come true].’[91]\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me\\r\\nand tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she is sitting by\\r\\nthe blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not\\r\\nremember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood\\r\\nwill talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any\\r\\nblood they will go away again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\\r\\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother\\r\\ncame up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me,\\r\\nsaying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are\\r\\nstill alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between\\r\\nus and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\\r\\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all\\r\\nthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got\\r\\nback to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Neptune.\\r\\nShe bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. They were the\\r\\nfinest children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking, Orion\\r\\nonly excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured\\r\\nnine cubits round the chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in\\r\\nOlympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount\\r\\nPelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would\\r\\nhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\\r\\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks\\r\\nor chin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician\\r\\nMinos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but he did not enjoy\\r\\nher, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the island of Dia on account\\r\\nof what Bacchus had said against her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband\\r\\nfor gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every single one of\\r\\nthe wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to go to\\r\\nbed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and\\r\\nyourselves will see to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\\r\\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good looking,\\r\\nand is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the\\r\\ndistinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the\\r\\npresents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all\\r\\nof you with great abundance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among them, “My\\r\\nfriends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us is both\\r\\nreasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision\\r\\nwhether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still live and\\r\\nreign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home, still\\r\\nwe must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, by which time I shall\\r\\nbe able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his\\r\\nescort it will be a matter for you all, and mine above all others as the chief\\r\\nperson among you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts,\\r\\nI should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage, for I\\r\\nshould return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected\\r\\nand beloved by all who see me when I get back to Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea that you\\r\\nare a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people going about who\\r\\ntell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there\\r\\nis a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition.\\r\\nMoreover you have told the story of your own misfortunes, and those of the\\r\\nArgives, as though you were a practiced bard; but tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nwhether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with\\r\\nyourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it\\r\\nis not yet bed time—go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\\r\\nhere listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us\\r\\nof your adventures.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and a time\\r\\nfor going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not refrain from\\r\\ntelling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall\\r\\nfighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery\\r\\nof a wicked woman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had\\r\\nperished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the\\r\\nblood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to\\r\\nembrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and\\r\\npitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you come by your death,’ said I, ‘King\\r\\nAgamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at\\r\\nsea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were\\r\\ncattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea in any\\r\\nstorm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the mainland, but\\r\\nAegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them. He asked me to\\r\\nhis house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a\\r\\nfat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like\\r\\nsheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some\\r\\ngreat nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\\r\\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable\\r\\nas the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\\r\\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard\\r\\nPriam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I\\r\\nlay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill\\r\\nthe slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close\\r\\nmy lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so\\r\\ncruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers\\r\\nwas. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home\\r\\nby my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace\\r\\non herself and all women who shall come after—even on the good ones.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in\\r\\nthe matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell for Helen’s sake,\\r\\nand now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your\\r\\nabsence.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly even with\\r\\nyour own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell\\r\\nher a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that your wife,\\r\\nUlysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and\\r\\nhas an excellent nature. We left her a young bride with an infant at her breast\\r\\nwhen we set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s\\r\\nestate,[96] and he\\r\\nand his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\\r\\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the\\r\\nhappiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore\\r\\nI say—and lay my saying to your heart—do not tell people when you are bringing\\r\\nyour ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is\\r\\nno trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news\\r\\nof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with\\r\\nMenelaus—for I presume that he is still living.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is\\r\\nalive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not know.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was the finest\\r\\nand goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The fleet\\r\\ndescendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son\\r\\nof Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake next, that you venture down\\r\\nto the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that\\r\\ncan labour no more?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I\\r\\ncame to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my return home\\r\\nto Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to\\r\\nset foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time. As for you,\\r\\nAchilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be,\\r\\nfor you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that\\r\\nyou are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it\\r\\nso much to heart even if you are dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a paid\\r\\nservant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of kings among the\\r\\ndead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a\\r\\ngreat soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about\\r\\nmy father Peleus—does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no\\r\\nrespect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him?\\r\\nCould I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that\\r\\nI had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but\\r\\nbe as I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one who\\r\\ntried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all about\\r\\nyour son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros with the\\r\\nAchaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and\\r\\nhis judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass\\r\\nhim; and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain\\r\\nwith the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all\\r\\nin valour. Many a man did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of\\r\\nthose whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say\\r\\nhow he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\\r\\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell\\r\\naround him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the\\r\\nArgives went inside the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to\\r\\nsettle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it,\\r\\nthough all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their\\r\\neyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear\\r\\nfrom his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the\\r\\nhorse—grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\\r\\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\\r\\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of\\r\\nwar) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat,\\r\\nfor the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow\\r\\nfull of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his\\r\\nson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy\\r\\ntale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still angry with me for\\r\\nhaving won the cause in our dispute about the armour of Achilles. Thetis had\\r\\noffered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges.\\r\\nWould that I had never gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life\\r\\nof Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\\r\\nstature and prowess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not forget and\\r\\nforgive even in death, but must the judgement about that hateful armour still\\r\\nrankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of\\r\\nstrength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son\\r\\nof Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which\\r\\nJove bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your\\r\\ndestruction—come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection,\\r\\nand hear what I can tell you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\\r\\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry,\\r\\nor I should have gone on talking to him,[97] only that there were still others\\r\\namong the dead whom I desired to see.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in\\r\\njudgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round\\r\\nhim in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences upon them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of\\r\\nthe wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great\\r\\nbronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine\\r\\nacres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks\\r\\ninto his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but\\r\\ncould not; for he had violated Jove’s mistress Leto as she was going through\\r\\nPanopeus on her way to Pytho.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his\\r\\nchin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for\\r\\nwhenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that\\r\\nthere was nothing but dry ground—parched by the spite of heaven. There were\\r\\ntall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates,\\r\\napples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched\\r\\nout his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the\\r\\nclouds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both\\r\\nhis hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill,\\r\\nbut always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight\\r\\nwould be too much for him, and the pitiless stone[98] would come thundering down again on\\r\\nto the plain. Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the\\r\\nsweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\\r\\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is\\r\\ndaughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared\\r\\nbirds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare bow in his\\r\\nhands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though ever on the point\\r\\nof taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the\\r\\nmost marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes;\\r\\nthere was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he\\r\\nmight, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once\\r\\nwhen he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor Ulysses, noble son of\\r\\nLaertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was\\r\\nabove ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\\r\\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me—a low fellow who set me all\\r\\nmanner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound—for he did not\\r\\nthink he could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound out\\r\\nof Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I\\r\\nwas in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me. And I should have\\r\\nseen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have\\r\\nseen—Theseus and Pirithous—glorious children of the gods, but so many thousands\\r\\nof ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic\\r\\nstricken lest Proserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of\\r\\nthat awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my\\r\\nmen to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took\\r\\ntheir places, whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We\\r\\nhad to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XII\\n\\r\\nTHE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open sea,\\r\\nwe went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sun-rise\\r\\nas in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on\\r\\nto the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men\\r\\nto Circe’s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood\\r\\nwhere the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and\\r\\nlamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armour had been\\r\\nburned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the\\r\\ncairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her\\r\\nmaid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then she stood\\r\\nin the midst of us and said, ‘You have done a bold thing in going down alive to\\r\\nthe house of Hades, and you will have died twice, to other people’s once; now,\\r\\nthen, stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your\\r\\nvoyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about\\r\\nyour course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering\\r\\nfrom misadventure either by land or sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men\\r\\nlaid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took\\r\\nme by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined\\r\\nby my side and asked me all about our adventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had ended my story, ‘and now pay attention\\r\\nto what I am about to tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your\\r\\nrecollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near\\r\\nthem. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the\\r\\nSirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit\\r\\nin a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song.\\r\\nThere is a great heap of dead men’s bones lying all around, with the flesh\\r\\nstill rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s\\r\\nears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\\r\\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross\\r\\npiece half way up the mast,[99] and they must lash the rope’s ends to\\r\\nthe mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and\\r\\npray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent\\r\\ndirections[100]\\r\\nas to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives\\r\\nbefore you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand there are\\r\\nsome overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat\\r\\nwith terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not\\r\\neven a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to\\r\\nFather Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove\\r\\nhas to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to\\r\\nthese rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\\r\\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that\\r\\never sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of\\r\\nAetes, and she too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Juno\\r\\npiloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark\\r\\ncloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer\\r\\nand early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could get a\\r\\nfoothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had\\r\\nbeen polished. In the middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and\\r\\nturned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so\\r\\nhigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside\\r\\nit Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young\\r\\nhound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one—not even a god—could\\r\\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six\\r\\nnecks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a\\r\\nfrightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together,\\r\\nso that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep\\r\\nwithin her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\\r\\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of\\r\\nthe thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her\\r\\nwithout losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries\\r\\noff a man in each mouth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together that\\r\\nthere is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig tree in full\\r\\nleaf[101] grows\\r\\nupon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in\\r\\nthe day does she vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down\\r\\nagain; see that you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune\\r\\nhimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as\\r\\nfast as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\\r\\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You dare devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to fight\\r\\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\\r\\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude,\\r\\ncruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get\\r\\nby her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock while you are\\r\\nputting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads,\\r\\nand snap up another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full\\r\\nspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla’s dam, bad luck to her;\\r\\nshe will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds\\r\\nof cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god—seven herds of cattle\\r\\nand seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not breed,\\r\\nnor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses\\r\\nPhaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera.\\r\\nTheir mother when she had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to\\r\\nthe Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after\\r\\ntheir father’s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think\\r\\nof nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but\\r\\nif you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\\r\\nof your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will return\\r\\nlate, in bad plight, after losing all your men.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon\\r\\nshe returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose the ship\\r\\nfrom her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, and began\\r\\nto smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and cunning goddess\\r\\nCirce befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily\\r\\nwith us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the\\r\\nship’s gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, ‘My friends, it is not\\r\\nright that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that Circe has\\r\\nmade me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live or die\\r\\nwe may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of the\\r\\nSirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I\\r\\nmight hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind\\r\\nme to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a\\r\\nbond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope’s ends to the\\r\\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly\\r\\nstill.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached the\\r\\nisland of the two Sirens,[102] for the wind had been very\\r\\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\\r\\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them;\\r\\nthen taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in\\r\\nrowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my\\r\\nsword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it\\r\\nsoon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then\\r\\nI stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast\\r\\nas I stood upright on the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\\r\\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate,\\r\\nthe Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come here,’ they sang, ‘renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name, and\\r\\nlisten to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying to hear\\r\\nthe enchanting sweetness of our song—and he who listens will go on his way not\\r\\nonly charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the\\r\\nArgives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you everything that is going to\\r\\nhappen over the whole world.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them further I\\r\\nmade signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free; but they\\r\\nquickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still\\r\\nstronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens’ voices. Then my\\r\\nmen took the wax from their ears and unbound me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from which\\r\\nspray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so frightened\\r\\nthat they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resounded with the\\r\\nrushing of the waters,[103] but the ship stayed where it was,\\r\\nfor the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted them man\\r\\nby man not to lose heart.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in danger,\\r\\nand we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops shut us up in his\\r\\ncave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved us then, and we shall\\r\\nlive to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say,\\r\\ntrust in Jove and row on with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are\\r\\nyour orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away\\r\\nfrom these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\\r\\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla,\\r\\nfor I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together\\r\\nin the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe’s strict instructions—I put\\r\\non my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship’s\\r\\nbows, for it was there that I expected first to see the monster of the rock,\\r\\nwho was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere,\\r\\nthough I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was\\r\\nScylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she\\r\\nvomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon\\r\\na great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When\\r\\nshe began to suck again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and\\r\\nround, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could\\r\\nsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\\r\\nat their wits ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were\\r\\nexpecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and\\r\\nsnatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and\\r\\nin a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the\\r\\nair as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one\\r\\nlast despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting\\r\\nrock[104] throws\\r\\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the\\r\\nox’s horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as\\r\\nhe catches them one by one—even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on\\r\\nher rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\\r\\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\\r\\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis,\\r\\nwe reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and\\r\\nsheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear\\r\\nthe cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then\\r\\nI remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.\\r\\nSo being much troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed,\\r\\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for\\r\\nit was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\\r\\ntherefore, away from the island.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an insolent\\r\\nanswer. ‘Ulysses,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and\\r\\nnever get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men are\\r\\nexhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook\\r\\nthemselves a good supper upon this island, but bid them put out to sea and go\\r\\nfaring fruitlessly on through the watches of the flying night. It is by night\\r\\nthat the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one\\r\\nof those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often wreck\\r\\na vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey\\r\\nthe behests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\\r\\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that heaven meant\\r\\nus a mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you are many against one,\\r\\nbut at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with\\r\\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a\\r\\nsingle head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given\\r\\nus.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made\\r\\nthe ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men\\r\\nwent ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\r\\ndrink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up\\r\\nand eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off\\r\\ninto a sound sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Jove\\r\\nraised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that land and sea were\\r\\ncovered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and\\r\\ndrew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I\\r\\ncalled the men together in council.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\\r\\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these\\r\\ncattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything.’ And again they promised that they would obey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was no\\r\\nother wind, but only South and East.[105] As long as corn and wine held out\\r\\nthe men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had\\r\\neaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with\\r\\nhook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands\\r\\non; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might\\r\\npray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough\\r\\nto be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and\\r\\nby they sent me off into a sweet sleep.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not anxious to\\r\\navoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck\\r\\nthe Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from\\r\\nescorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a\\r\\nhuge mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very moment\\r\\nwhen the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into\\r\\na rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and\\r\\nyou can then bury their city under the mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\\r\\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way,\\r\\nhad got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it\\r\\ndown with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he\\r\\nwent away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards\\r\\nhis neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship\\r\\nin the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the whole of her\\r\\nonly a moment ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous said, “I\\r\\nremember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Neptune would be angry\\r\\nwith us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a\\r\\nPhaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a\\r\\nhigh mountain. This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all\\r\\ncoming true.[117]\\r\\nNow therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off\\r\\ngiving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\\r\\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our\\r\\ncity under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they were afraid and\\r\\ngot ready the bulls.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune, standing\\r\\nround his altar; and at the same time[118] Ulysses woke up once more upon his\\r\\nown soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover,\\r\\nJove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know\\r\\nof his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his\\r\\nwife or his fellow citizens and friends recognising him[119] until he had taken his revenge upon\\r\\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him—the\\r\\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees,\\r\\nappeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land. So he\\r\\nsmote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage\\r\\nand uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put all this treasure,\\r\\nand which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over there with the Phaeacians; or\\r\\nI could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and\\r\\ngiven me an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I\\r\\ncannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good\\r\\ntruth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by\\r\\nme, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to\\r\\nIthaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise\\r\\nthem, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I\\r\\nsuppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but\\r\\nthere was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own\\r\\ncountry, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing\\r\\nhis hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of\\r\\ndelicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her\\r\\nshoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in this\\r\\ncountry; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed towards me.\\r\\nProtect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and\\r\\ncountry is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea\\r\\nboard of some continent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from\\r\\nsomewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is a very\\r\\ncelebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a\\r\\ngood driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of\\r\\nit. It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain\\r\\nand dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and\\r\\nthere are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of\\r\\nIthaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off\\r\\nfrom this Achaean country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country,\\r\\nand he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and made up a lying\\r\\nstory in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it\\r\\nseems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as much more\\r\\nbehind me for my children, but am flying because I killed Orsilochus son of\\r\\nIdomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob\\r\\nme of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on\\r\\nthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served\\r\\nhis father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\\r\\nruler, so I lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the road side, and\\r\\nspeared him as he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark\\r\\nnight and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him,\\r\\nbut as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were\\r\\nPhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the\\r\\nEpeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile,\\r\\nbut the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\\r\\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of us said\\r\\na word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay\\r\\ndown just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took\\r\\nmy goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the\\r\\nsand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress\\r\\nof mind.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she\\r\\ntook the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be indeed a shifty\\r\\nlying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all manner of craft even\\r\\nthough you had a god for your antagonist. Dare devil that you are, full of\\r\\nguile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive\\r\\nfalsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no\\r\\nmore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are\\r\\nthe most accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for\\r\\ndiplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know Jove’s\\r\\ndaughter Minerva—me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in\\r\\nall your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you?\\r\\nAnd now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to\\r\\nhide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the\\r\\ntroubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell\\r\\nno one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\\r\\nand put up with every man’s insolence, without a word.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so\\r\\nconstantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter\\r\\nfor him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know\\r\\nexceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting\\r\\nbefore Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship after having\\r\\nsacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw\\r\\nno more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a\\r\\ndifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from\\r\\nevil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took\\r\\nme into the town.[120] And now, I beseech you in your\\r\\nfather’s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\\r\\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in\\r\\nall you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\\r\\ncountry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied Minerva,\\r\\n“and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible,\\r\\nshrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage\\r\\nwould at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem\\r\\nto care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have\\r\\nexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no\\r\\npeace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\\r\\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back\\r\\nsafely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with\\r\\nmy uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.[121] I will now,\\r\\nhowever, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps\\r\\nbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive\\r\\ntree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;[122] here too is\\r\\nthe overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to\\r\\nthe nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Ulysses\\r\\nrejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous\\r\\nsoil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, “Naiad nymphs,\\r\\ndaughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore\\r\\nI greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in\\r\\nthe old days, if Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my\\r\\nson to manhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva, “let us\\r\\nrather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be\\r\\nquite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places,\\r\\nwhile Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing\\r\\nwhich the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and\\r\\nMinerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the\\r\\nroot of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the\\r\\nwicked suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on\\r\\nthese disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three\\r\\nyears, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does\\r\\nnothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending encouraging messages[123] to every one\\r\\nof them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to\\r\\nmuch the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me\\r\\nsuch timely information. Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my\\r\\nside and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy’s\\r\\nfair diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three\\r\\nhundred men, if you, goddess, will be with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once we set\\r\\nabout it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance\\r\\nwill then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin by\\r\\ndisguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body\\r\\nwith wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a\\r\\ngarment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine\\r\\neyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of\\r\\nyour wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the\\r\\nswineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected\\r\\ntowards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding\\r\\nhis pigs near the rock that is called Raven[124] by the fountain Arethusa, where\\r\\nthey are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with\\r\\nhim and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your\\r\\nson, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out\\r\\nwhether you are still alive.”[125]\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did\\r\\nyou want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others\\r\\nare eating up his estate?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be well\\r\\nspoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite\\r\\ncomfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The\\r\\nsuitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to\\r\\nkill him before he can get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but\\r\\nrather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a\\r\\ngrave themselves.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will get\\r\\nUlysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a\\r\\nlodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth;\\r\\nevery one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her\\r\\nfalsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks them all\\r\\nmanner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have lost\\r\\ntheir husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless\\r\\nmake up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\\r\\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones\\r\\nare lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and\\r\\na bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go where I may I\\r\\nshall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother\\r\\nand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my\\r\\nparents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country;\\r\\nit is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without\\r\\nreverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took\\r\\nsuch care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of belief\\r\\nabout your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but\\r\\nwill swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till he has\\r\\nactually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will.\\r\\nI am in great want, but I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a\\r\\nman, even as I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\\r\\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses\\r\\nto which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will.\\r\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\r\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill\\r\\ntreating his wife and son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither get paid\\r\\nfor bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in\\r\\npeace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all\\r\\nthis; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honoured master. As for\\r\\nyour oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope,\\r\\nhis old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about\\r\\nthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be\\r\\nno worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or\\r\\nman, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get\\r\\nnews of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\r\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca.\\r\\nBut let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape\\r\\nif the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,\\r\\ntell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where\\r\\nyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came\\r\\nin, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to\\r\\ncome—for you cannot have come by land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat and\\r\\nwine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat\\r\\nand drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole\\r\\ntwelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has\\r\\npleased heaven to visit me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many sons born\\r\\nin marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a\\r\\nconcubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage I claim,\\r\\nand who was held in the highest honour among the Cretans for his wealth,\\r\\nprosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me on the same level with my\\r\\nbrothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but\\r\\nto me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me\\r\\nto marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on\\r\\nthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you\\r\\ncan see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\r\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy\\r\\nwith an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to\\r\\nleap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I\\r\\ndid not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\\r\\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things\\r\\nthat most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another\\r\\nanother, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the\\r\\nAchaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign\\r\\nservice, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first\\r\\ninstance, and much more was allotted to me later on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove\\r\\ncounselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people\\r\\nrequired me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there was no way out\\r\\nof it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years,\\r\\nbut in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven\\r\\ndispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one\\r\\nmonth happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the\\r\\nidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.\\r\\nI had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my\\r\\nmen made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\r\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from\\r\\nCrete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a river.\\r\\nNothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but\\r\\nsat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On\\r\\nthe fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\\r\\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out\\r\\nscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\n---------new doc---------\\nBOOK XV\\n\\r\\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS AT PYLOS\\r\\nAND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA—ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son that he\\r\\nwas to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt\\r\\nof Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus could get no\\r\\nrest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to\\r\\nhim and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave\\r\\nyour property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up\\r\\neverything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand. Ask\\r\\nMenelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother\\r\\nstill there when you get back. Her father and brothers are already urging her\\r\\nto marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any of the others, and has\\r\\nbeen greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\\r\\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they\\r\\nalways want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never\\r\\ngive another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their\\r\\nfather either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\\r\\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until\\r\\nit shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of\\r\\nanother matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors\\r\\nare lying in wait for you in the Strait[128] between Ithaca and Samos, and they\\r\\nmean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\\r\\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your\\r\\nproperty will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship\\r\\nwell away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will\\r\\nsend you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to\\r\\nthe town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\\r\\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night,\\r\\nand then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from\\r\\nPylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with his heel\\r\\nto rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the horses to the\\r\\nchariot, for we must set off home.”[129]\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the\\r\\ndark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his presents and\\r\\nput them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to us in the usual\\r\\nway. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him\\r\\nkindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, leaving\\r\\nHelen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put on his shirt as\\r\\nfast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to meet\\r\\nhim. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go back now to my own country, for I want to\\r\\nget home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not detain\\r\\nyou. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to\\r\\nhim. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants\\r\\nto do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should\\r\\ntreat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to\\r\\nleave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot,\\r\\nand till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\\r\\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a\\r\\nlong journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in\\r\\nthe Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all\\r\\nour principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will\\r\\ngive us something—a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I came\\r\\naway I left my property without protection, and fear that while looking for my\\r\\nfather I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been\\r\\nstolen during my absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At this moment\\r\\nEteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaus\\r\\ntold him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then\\r\\nMenelaus went down into his fragrant store room,[130] not alone, but Helen went too, with\\r\\nMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his house were\\r\\nkept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a\\r\\nsilver mixing bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely\\r\\ndresses which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was\\r\\nlargest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a\\r\\nstar, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. [131] Then they all came back through the\\r\\nhouse again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may\\r\\nJove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your\\r\\ndesire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate\\r\\nin all my house. It is a mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is\\r\\ninlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\\r\\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on\\r\\nmy return home. I should like to give it to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, while\\r\\nMegapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before him. Hard by\\r\\nstood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from the hand\\r\\nof Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day. Till then, get\\r\\nyour dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own\\r\\ncountry and to your home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son of\\r\\nNisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors\\r\\nfrom the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation,\\r\\nmoreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other suitors,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good natural disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking\\r\\nto them plainly and in all honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus.\\r\\nIt is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take\\r\\ncounsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to\\r\\nkill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us,\\r\\nI would have you hold your hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and\\r\\nwent to the house of Ulysses, where they took their accustomed seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She knew of\\r\\nthe plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard their counsels\\r\\nand had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens,\\r\\nand when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts\\r\\nsupporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked\\r\\nAntinous saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and\\r\\ncounsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind.\\r\\nMadman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, and take no heed\\r\\nof suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot\\r\\nthus against one another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this\\r\\nhouse in fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\\r\\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us?\\r\\nThey wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\r\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife and\\r\\ntrying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope\\r\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. The man\\r\\nis not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son\\r\\nTelemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time\\r\\nhas Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put\\r\\npieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I\\r\\nhave, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death\\r\\ncomes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her,\\r\\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva shed\\r\\nsleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son,\\r\\nwho had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another\\r\\nto get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an\\r\\nold man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for\\r\\nfear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and\\r\\ntell Penelope.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,” said he.\\r\\n“What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they still\\r\\nwaiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in the\\r\\ntown. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met\\r\\na man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he was the first to\\r\\ntell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had\\r\\njust got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a\\r\\nship coming into harbour with a number of men in her. They had many shields and\\r\\nspears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus could not\\r\\nsee him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate it,\\r\\nand every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they\\r\\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET—ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE TOWN, AND\\r\\nULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS—HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG ARGOS—HE IS\\r\\nINSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE\\r\\nSHALL BE SENT TO HER.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on\\r\\nhis sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go\\r\\ninto the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd, “I will now go to the\\r\\ntown and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till\\r\\nshe has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let\\r\\nhim beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have\\r\\ntrouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this\\r\\nmakes him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do\\r\\nbetter in town than country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am\\r\\ntoo old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.\\r\\nTherefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as\\r\\nsoon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it.\\r\\nMy clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished\\r\\nwith cold, for you say the city is some way off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the\\r\\nsuitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the\\r\\ncloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\\r\\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the\\r\\nother maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.\\r\\nPenelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she\\r\\nflung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful\\r\\neyes, “Light of my eyes,” she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are\\r\\ncome home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of\\r\\nyour having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my\\r\\nconsent. But come, tell me what you saw.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far country.\\r\\nIf he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what\\r\\nhe could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from\\r\\nhim when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for\\r\\nhis master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never\\r\\ndo their work when their master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes\\r\\nhalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors\\r\\nwere, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come\\r\\nand sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the\\r\\ncarver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought\\r\\nit to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought\\r\\nhim his portion, and gave him bread from the bread-basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable old\\r\\nbeggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon\\r\\nthe threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the\\r\\ninner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had\\r\\nskilfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus\\r\\ntook a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in\\r\\nhis two hands, and said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to\\r\\ngo the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you this, and\\r\\nsays you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and fulfil\\r\\nthe desire of his heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on the\\r\\ndirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing,\\r\\nand had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the\\r\\nbard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of\\r\\nbread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they\\r\\nwere, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to\\r\\nsave a single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from\\r\\nleft to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\\r\\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another\\r\\nwho he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\\r\\n“Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have\\r\\nseen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the\\r\\nman himself, nor where he comes from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he cried,\\r\\n“what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars\\r\\nenough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing\\r\\nthat such people gather here to waste your master’s property—and must you needs\\r\\nbring this man as well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil. It was\\r\\nno doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a\\r\\nforeign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer,\\r\\na healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his singing?\\r\\nSuch men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar\\r\\nwho will only worry him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of\\r\\nthe other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as\\r\\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\\r\\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of my\\r\\ninterests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this stranger\\r\\nturned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him\\r\\nyourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any\\r\\nof the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I say, for\\r\\nyou are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other\\r\\npeople.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering talk? If\\r\\nall the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here\\r\\nagain for another three months.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the\\r\\ntable, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors\\r\\nall gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was\\r\\nabout, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had\\r\\ngiven him, but he first went up to Antinous and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to\\r\\nbe a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver,\\r\\nand I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich man once, and had\\r\\na fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am,\\r\\nno matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and\\r\\nall the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\\r\\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\\r\\nrobbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my\\r\\nships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over\\r\\nthem, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the\\r\\nwar-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with\\r\\nsoldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic\\r\\namong my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\\r\\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive\\r\\nto do forced labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met\\r\\nthem, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in\\r\\nCyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us\\r\\nduring our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,[145] or I will give\\r\\nyou Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have\\r\\nbegged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have\\r\\nabundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people’s property\\r\\nwhen there is plenty of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, “You wretch, I\\r\\nwill soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too.\\r\\nHas the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?\\r\\nYou seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus.” With this he\\r\\ncaught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of\\r\\nAmphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his\\r\\nright hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and\\r\\nhis wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\\r\\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, “I\\r\\nwish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble\\r\\nhe gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\\r\\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry\\r\\nyour meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do\\r\\nnot wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the\\r\\nsooner you all go home to bed the better.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; but\\r\\nAmphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do not let us take\\r\\noffence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence\\r\\nto the stranger nor to any of Ulysses’ servants. Let the cupbearer go round\\r\\nwith the drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house\\r\\nthat he has come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of Dulichium,\\r\\nservant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round\\r\\nto each of them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the\\r\\nblessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each\\r\\none as he was minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own\\r\\nabode.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR—ULYSSES INTERVIEWS PENELOPE—EURYCLEA\\r\\nWASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO\\r\\nULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside. Make some\\r\\nexcuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have\\r\\ntaken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it\\r\\nwas when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add\\r\\nto this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\r\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\r\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Euryclea\\r\\nand said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take the armour that\\r\\nmy father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now\\r\\nmy father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood.\\r\\nI want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish, child,” answered Euryclea, “that you would take the management of the\\r\\nhouse into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself.\\r\\nBut who is to go with you and light you to the store-room? The maids would have\\r\\ndone so, but you would not let them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The stranger,” said Telemachus, “shall show me a light; when people eat my\\r\\nbread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then\\r\\nUlysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears\\r\\ninside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a\\r\\nsoft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, “Father, my eyes behold a\\r\\ngreat marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on\\r\\nwhich they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god\\r\\nhere who has come down from heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for this is\\r\\nthe manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here to talk with\\r\\nyour mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts of\\r\\nquestions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to\\r\\nthe room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and they set\\r\\nher a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her\\r\\naccustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool all in one\\r\\npiece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she\\r\\nnow sat, and the maids came from the women’s room to join her. They set about\\r\\nremoving the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away\\r\\nthe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\\r\\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both\\r\\nlight and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,\\r\\n“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and\\r\\nspying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\r\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be so angry\\r\\nwith me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and\\r\\nbecause I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars\\r\\ngenerally? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\\r\\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor\\r\\nwhat he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\\r\\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to\\r\\ntake all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that\\r\\npride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest\\r\\nyou get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home,\\r\\nfor there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as\\r\\nyou think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus,\\r\\nwho will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\\r\\nlonger in his boyhood.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat-basket in which it lay,\\r\\nand threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little aside, and\\r\\navoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion[159] as he did so, and it hit the wall,\\r\\nnot him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, “It is a good thing\\r\\nfor you,” said he, “that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him.\\r\\nIf you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father\\r\\nwould have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this\\r\\nhouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\\r\\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\\r\\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you\\r\\nkilling my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put up with\\r\\nthis, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence. Still,\\r\\nif you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such\\r\\ndisgraceful scenes day after day—guests insulted, and men dragging the women\\r\\nservants about the house in an unseemly way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, “No one\\r\\nshould take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite\\r\\nreasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of\\r\\nthe servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to\\r\\nTelemachus and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’\\r\\nI would say, ‘as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come\\r\\nhome, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering[160] the suitors to\\r\\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but\\r\\nit is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\\r\\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one\\r\\nwho makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to\\r\\nmanage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother\\r\\nwill look after some other man’s house, not yours.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\\r\\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering in\\r\\nsome distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother’s marriage; on\\r\\nthe contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her\\r\\nnumberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she\\r\\nshall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits\\r\\nwandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became\\r\\nsmeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy\\r\\nwith forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, “Unhappy men, what is it that\\r\\nails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your\\r\\ncheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and\\r\\nroof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\\r\\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of\\r\\nheaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus then said,\\r\\n“This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him\\r\\nout into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me. I have\\r\\neyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding\\r\\nmind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief\\r\\noverhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and\\r\\nplotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome,\\r\\nbut the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking Telemachus by\\r\\nlaughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, “Telemachus, you\\r\\nare not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes\\r\\nbegging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is\\r\\nperfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as\\r\\na prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board\\r\\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting\\r\\nevery moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed\\r\\nfor her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one\\r\\nwas saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment; it had\\r\\nbeen both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the\\r\\nsupper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the\\r\\nmeal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them—for they had\\r\\nbrought their doom upon themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\r\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS AND\\r\\nPHILOETIUS\\n---------new doc---------\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table[165]—for those which the Achaeans were\\r\\nso shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver—he laid it on the\\r\\ncentre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward\\r\\nhim, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow\\r\\npierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till\\r\\nit had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to\\r\\nTelemachus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at,\\r\\nand I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the\\r\\nsuitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to\\r\\nprepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport\\r\\nthemselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his\\r\\nsword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\r\\nTHE KILLING OF THE SUITORS—THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES ARE MADE\\r\\nTO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his\\r\\nbow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his\\r\\nfeet and said, “The mighty contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo\\r\\nwill vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a\\r\\ntwo-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. He had\\r\\nno thought of death—who amongst all the revellers would think that one man,\\r\\nhowever brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck\\r\\nAntinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he\\r\\nfell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood\\r\\ngushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on\\r\\nit, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to\\r\\nthe ground.[166]\\r\\nThe suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they\\r\\nsprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere\\r\\ntowards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked\\r\\nUlysses very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you shall pay for shooting people\\r\\nin this way: you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you\\r\\nhave slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you\\r\\nfor having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and\\r\\ndid not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But\\r\\nUlysses glared at them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have wasted my\\r\\nsubstance,[167]\\r\\nhave forced my women servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I\\r\\nwas still living. You have feared neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see\\r\\nwhither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We have done\\r\\nmuch wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was the head and\\r\\nfront of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that\\r\\nhe wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted\\r\\nwas something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted\\r\\nto kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met\\r\\nthe death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\\r\\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten\\r\\nand drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will\\r\\nkeep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have\\r\\ndone this no one can complain of your being enraged against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all that you\\r\\nhave in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my\\r\\nhand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your\\r\\nlives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and\\r\\nshoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight;\\r\\ndraw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us\\r\\nhave at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can\\r\\nthen get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with\\r\\na loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his\\r\\nbreast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped\\r\\nhis sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went\\r\\nover on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of\\r\\ndeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him\\r\\naway from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and struck him from\\r\\nbehind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his\\r\\nchest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his\\r\\nforehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the\\r\\nbody, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans\\r\\nmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off\\r\\nat a run, and immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your\\r\\ntemples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour for the\\r\\nswineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or when I am\\r\\nalone they may get me away from the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the\\r\\narmour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets\\r\\nwith horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed\\r\\nhimself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour,\\r\\nand took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows\\r\\nlasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one\\r\\nanother: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall\\r\\nof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his\\r\\nshoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of\\r\\nhorse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,[168] and he grasped two redoubtable\\r\\nbronze-shod spears.\\n---------new doc---------\\nNow there was a trap door[169] on the wall, while at one end of\\r\\nthe pavement[170]\\r\\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a\\r\\nwell-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for\\r\\nonly one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot\\r\\nsome one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on? Help\\r\\nwould come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the narrow\\r\\npassage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man\\r\\ncould prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will\\r\\nbring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and\\r\\nhis son have put them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room of\\r\\nUlysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears,\\r\\nand brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors. Ulysses’\\r\\nheart began to fail him when he saw the suitors[171] putting on their armour and\\r\\nbrandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to\\r\\nTelemachus, “Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or\\r\\nit may be Melanthius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the\\r\\nstore room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go,\\r\\nEumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing\\r\\nthis, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the son of Dolius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the store room\\r\\nto fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was\\r\\nbeside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel Melanthius,\\r\\njust as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if\\r\\nI can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your\\r\\nown revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter\\r\\nwhat they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands and feet behind\\r\\nhim. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then\\r\\nfasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a\\r\\nhigh bearing-post,[172] that he may linger on in an agony.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store\\r\\nroom, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was busy searching\\r\\nfor arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on\\r\\neither side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet\\r\\nin one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by\\r\\nLaertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\\r\\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the\\r\\nhair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\\r\\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told\\r\\nthem; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high\\r\\npillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O\\r\\nswineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as\\r\\nyou deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of\\r\\nOceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to\\r\\nfeast on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their\\r\\narmour they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by\\r\\nthe side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce and\\r\\nfull of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still\\r\\nboth brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having\\r\\nassumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and\\r\\nsaid, “Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many\\r\\ngood turns he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the other\\r\\nside raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to reproach her.\\r\\n“Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him and\\r\\nfighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when we have killed these\\r\\npeople, father and son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your\\r\\nhead, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out,\\r\\nand bring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons\\r\\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live\\r\\nin the city of Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily.[173] “Ulysses,”\\r\\nsaid she, “your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you\\r\\nfought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You\\r\\nkilled many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s\\r\\ncity was taken. How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that\\r\\nyou are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?\\r\\nCome on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcimus\\r\\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to\\r\\nprove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the\\r\\nrafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\\r\\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the\\r\\nsuitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were\\r\\nby far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of\\r\\nUlysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My friends, he will soon have to\\r\\nleave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.\\r\\nThey are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but\\r\\nsix of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with\\r\\nglory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\\r\\nothers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of no\\r\\neffect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft\\r\\nof another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of\\r\\nthe suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My friends, I should say we too had\\r\\nbetter let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they\\r\\nhave done us by killing us outright.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Ulysses\\r\\nkilled Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockman\\r\\nkilled Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a\\r\\ncorner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing\\r\\nthem from the bodies of the dead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for\\r\\nthe most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the cloister; another\\r\\nwent against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall.\\r\\nStill, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus’s\\r\\nwrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but\\r\\nthe spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive\\r\\ninto the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and\\r\\nEumaeus Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\\r\\ntaunted him saying, “Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so foolish as\\r\\nto talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods\\r\\nare far stronger than men. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for\\r\\nthe foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging about in his own house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a spear in\\r\\nclose fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the\\r\\ndart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the\\r\\nground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and\\r\\nthe hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like\\r\\na herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at\\r\\ntheir longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop\\r\\ndown on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,\\r\\nfor they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport—even so did\\r\\nUlysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They\\r\\nmade a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground\\r\\nseethed with their blood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, “Ulysses I beseech you have\\r\\nmercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house\\r\\neither in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they\\r\\nwould not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their\\r\\nsacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to\\r\\ndeserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, “If you were their sacrificing\\r\\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got\\r\\nhome again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.\\r\\nTherefore you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when he was\\r\\nbeing killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on\\r\\nthe back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was\\r\\nyet speaking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he who had been forced by the suitors to\\r\\nsing to them—now tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap\\r\\ndoor,[174] and\\r\\nheld his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to fly out of the cloister\\r\\nand sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which\\r\\nboth Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or\\r\\nwhether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\\r\\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground\\r\\nbetween the mixing bowl [175] and the silver-studded seat; then\\r\\ngoing up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, “Ulysses, I beseech\\r\\nyou have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you\\r\\nkill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays\\r\\nmyself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my\\r\\nhead off. Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent\\r\\nyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\\r\\nand too strong for me, so they made me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he cried, “the\\r\\nman is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always\\r\\ngood to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has already killed\\r\\nhim, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat\\r\\nbeneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed\\r\\nheifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid hold\\r\\nof his knees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay your hand therefore, and tell your\\r\\nfather, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted\\r\\nhis substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved your life,\\r\\nthat you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good\\r\\ndeeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the\\r\\nouter court, and be out of the way of the slaughter—you and the bard—while I\\r\\nfinish my work here inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by\\r\\nJove’s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they\\r\\nwould be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over, to see\\r\\nif anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them\\r\\nall lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which\\r\\nfishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping\\r\\nfor water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the\\r\\nsuitors lying all huddled up one against the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, “Call nurse Euryclea; I have something to say\\r\\nto her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women’s room. “Make haste,” said\\r\\nhe, “you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house.\\r\\nCome outside; my father wishes to speak to you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women’s room and came\\r\\nout, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast\\r\\nand both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was\\r\\nUlysses besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses\\r\\nand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw\\r\\nthat a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, “Old woman,” said he,\\r\\n“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it\\r\\nis an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and their own evil\\r\\ndeeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the\\r\\nwhole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a\\r\\nbad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me\\r\\nwhich of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are\\r\\ninnocent.”[176]\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you the truth, my son,” answered Euryclea. “There are fifty women\\r\\nin the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of\\r\\nhousehold work. Of these, twelve in all[177] have misbehaved, and have been\\r\\nwanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to\\r\\nTelemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to\\r\\ngive orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife\\r\\nall that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not wake her yet,” answered Ulysses, “but tell the women who have\\r\\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses; in\\r\\nthe meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the swineherd. “Begin,”\\r\\nsaid he, “to remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges\\r\\nand clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly\\r\\ncleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed\\r\\nroom and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords\\r\\ntill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in\\r\\nwhich they used to lie in secret with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they\\r\\ncarried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the\\r\\ngatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so\\r\\nthey had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the\\r\\ntables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others\\r\\nshovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all\\r\\naway and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite\\r\\nclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space\\r\\nbetween the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not\\r\\nget away: and Telemachus said to the other two, “I shall not let these women\\r\\ndie a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to\\r\\nsleep with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying he made a ship’s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\\r\\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building,\\r\\nat a good height, lest any of the women’s feet should touch the ground; and as\\r\\nthrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket\\r\\njust as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even\\r\\nso did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die\\r\\nmost miserably.[178] Their feet moved convulsively for a\\r\\nwhile, but not for very long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner court.\\r\\nThere they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave\\r\\nthem to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the\\r\\nhouse, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea,\\r\\n“Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may\\r\\nburn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here\\r\\nwith her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All that you have said is true,” answered Euryclea, “but let me bring you some\\r\\nclean clothes—a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any\\r\\nlonger. It is not right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First light me a fire,” replied Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly\\r\\npurified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went\\r\\ninside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came\\r\\nfrom their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to\\r\\nembrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It\\r\\nmade him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of\\r\\nthem.[179]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\r\\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND—EARLY IN THE MORNING ULYSSES,\\r\\nTELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband\\r\\nhad come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for\\r\\njoy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.\\r\\n“Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she exclaimed, “and see with your own eyes\\r\\nsomething that you have been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last\\r\\nindeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much\\r\\ntrouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill treating his son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good nurse,” answered Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods sometimes send\\r\\nsome very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become\\r\\nsensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you always used to\\r\\nbe a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough\\r\\nalready—talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had\\r\\ntaken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from\\r\\nthe day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\\r\\nagain into the women’s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to\\r\\nbring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding.\\r\\nAs it is your age shall protect you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear child,” answered Euryclea, “I am not mocking you. It is quite true as\\r\\nI tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all\\r\\nkept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew all the time that he\\r\\nwas come back, but kept his father’s secret that he might have his revenge on\\r\\nall these wicked people.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, and wept\\r\\nfor joy. “But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to me; if he has really\\r\\ncome home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single\\r\\nhanded, seeing what a number of them there always were?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was not there,” answered Euryclea, “and do not know; I only heard them\\r\\ngroaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a\\r\\ncorner of the women’s room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch\\r\\nme because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses\\r\\nthat were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other. You would\\r\\nhave enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all\\r\\npiled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\\r\\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so\\r\\ncome with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the\\r\\ndesire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both\\r\\nwife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the\\r\\nsuitors who behaved so badly to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “do not exult too confidently over all this.\\r\\nYou know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come home—more\\r\\nparticularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but what you\\r\\ntell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for\\r\\ntheir great wickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man\\r\\nin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have\\r\\ncome to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away\\r\\nfrom the Achaean land; he will never return home again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, “My child, what are you talking about? but you were\\r\\nall hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never\\r\\ncoming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very\\r\\nmoment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing him I\\r\\nperceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about\\r\\nit, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth;\\r\\nso come with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you,\\r\\nyou may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “however wise you may be you can hardly fathom\\r\\nthe counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I\\r\\nmay see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered\\r\\nwhether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or\\r\\nwhether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the\\r\\nfire, against the wall at right angles[180] [to that by which she had entered],\\r\\nwhile Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and\\r\\nwaiting to see what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a\\r\\nlong time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\\r\\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\\r\\nclothes and failed to recognise him,[181] till Telemachus began to reproach\\r\\nher and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother—but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why do you\\r\\nkeep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin\\r\\ntalking to him and asking him questions? No other woman could bear to keep away\\r\\nfrom her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\\r\\nand after having gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a\\r\\nstone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope answered, “My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no\\r\\nwords in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look\\r\\nhim straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his own\\r\\nhome again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there\\r\\nare tokens with which we two are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from\\r\\nall others.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me to any\\r\\nproof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me\\r\\nfor the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with\\r\\ndirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better\\r\\ndo next. When one man has killed another—even though he was not one who would\\r\\nleave many friends to take up his quarrel—the man who has killed him must still\\r\\nsay good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\\r\\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\\r\\nconsider this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look to it yourself, father,” answered Telemachus, “for they say you are the\\r\\nwisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can\\r\\ncompare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find\\r\\nus fail you in so far as our strength holds out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will say what I think will be best,” answered Ulysses. “First wash and put\\r\\nyour shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemius\\r\\nshall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,\\r\\nor any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice\\r\\nit, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the\\r\\ndeath of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\\r\\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\\r\\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put\\r\\ntheir shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took his lyre and set\\r\\nthem all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the\\r\\nsound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, “I suppose the\\r\\nqueen has been getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for\\r\\nnot continuing to protect her husband’s property until he comes home.”[182]\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made\\r\\nthe bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse\\r\\nwent back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman\\r\\nEurynome[183] to\\r\\nshow Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to\\r\\ntheir room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own\\r\\nold bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\\r\\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncloisters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one\\r\\nanother. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled\\r\\nwith a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her\\r\\naccount, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what\\r\\nhe had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He\\r\\ntold her everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to\\r\\nsleep till he had ended his whole story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\\r\\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops and how he\\r\\nhad punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he then\\r\\nwent on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way,\\r\\nbut even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane\\r\\ncarried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city\\r\\nTelepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save\\r\\nhimself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and\\r\\nhow he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who\\r\\nbore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous\\r\\nsinging of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible\\r\\nCharybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\\r\\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with\\r\\nhis thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being\\r\\nleft alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso,\\r\\nwho kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\\r\\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering\\r\\nhe had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had\\r\\nbeen a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given\\r\\nhim gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\\r\\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that Ulysses had\\r\\nhad both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of\\r\\nOceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his\\r\\ncomfortable bed and said to Penelope, “Wife, we have both of us had our full\\r\\nshare of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented\\r\\nfrom getting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,\\r\\nthat we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\\r\\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will\\r\\ntake many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\\r\\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to\\r\\nthe wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been\\r\\ngrieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though\\r\\nyou have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have\\r\\nbeen killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore,[184] and stay there with your women. See\\r\\nnobody and ask no questions.”[185]\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and\\r\\nEumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they did, and\\r\\narmed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied\\r\\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless\\r\\nconcealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES—ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE OF\\r\\nLAERTES—THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA CONCLUDES\\r\\nA PEACE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he\\r\\nheld the fair golden wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them\\r\\njust as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they\\r\\nfollowed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow\\r\\nof some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which\\r\\nthey hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of\\r\\nsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\\r\\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and\\r\\nthe land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the\\r\\nsouls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus,\\r\\nAntilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaans\\r\\nafter the son of Peleus himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon\\r\\njoined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of\\r\\nthose who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus; and the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles spoke first.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that Jove had loved you better from\\r\\nfirst to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many and brave\\r\\nmen, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the hand of death,\\r\\nwhich no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had\\r\\nyou fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have\\r\\nbuilt a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good\\r\\nname, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Happy son of Peleus,” answered the ghost of Agamemnon, “for having died at\\r\\nTroy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell\\r\\nround you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\\r\\nall huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the\\r\\nlivelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane\\r\\nto stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\\r\\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments.\\r\\nThe Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,\\r\\nwhen she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the\\r\\nsound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked\\r\\nfor fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old\\r\\nNestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, fly\\r\\nnot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her\\r\\nimmortal nymphs to view the body of her son.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man\\r\\nof the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal\\r\\nraiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in\\r\\nlament—calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for\\r\\npity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned you,\\r\\nmortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and\\r\\nmany a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were\\r\\nburnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\\r\\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with\\r\\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their\\r\\nwork, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and\\r\\nin pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them—gift of\\r\\nBacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones\\r\\nwith those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also\\r\\nthose of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades\\r\\nnow that Patroclus was no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out\\r\\nover the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by\\r\\nthose now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother begged\\r\\nprizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of\\r\\nthe Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when\\r\\nthe young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death\\r\\nof some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\r\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your\\r\\nfame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all\\r\\nmankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were\\r\\ndone? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus\\r\\nand those of my wicked wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts\\r\\nof the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of Agamemnon and\\r\\nAchilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once. The ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had\\r\\nbeen his host, so it began to talk to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Amphimedon,” it said, “what has happened to all you fine young men—all of an\\r\\nage too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could pick no finer\\r\\nbody of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you\\r\\nwhen you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland\\r\\nwhen you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you\\r\\nnot remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to\\r\\njoin us with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume\\r\\nour voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I\\r\\nremember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately\\r\\nabout the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses had been long gone,\\r\\nand we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not\\r\\nmarry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our\\r\\ndestruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great\\r\\ntambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\\r\\nneedlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\\r\\npress me to marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in\\r\\nneedlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\\r\\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\\r\\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is what she said,\\r\\nand we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day\\r\\nlong, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She\\r\\nfooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time\\r\\nwore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many\\r\\ndays had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told\\r\\nus, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\\r\\nwhether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after\\r\\nshe had had it washed,[186] its splendour was as that of the\\r\\nsun or moon.\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round the\\r\\ntown, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as\\r\\nsoon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter,\\r\\ngroaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took the dead away,\\r\\nburied every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere\\r\\non board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own\\r\\nplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got\\r\\ntogether Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\\r\\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\\r\\nweeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He\\r\\ntook many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both\\r\\nships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the\\r\\nforemost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get\\r\\naway to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of\\r\\nourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we\\r\\ndo not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should\\r\\nhave no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then,\\r\\nand after them, before they can cross over to the main land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemius\\r\\nhad now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses. Every one was\\r\\nastonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and\\r\\nMedon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not do these things against\\r\\nthe will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and\\r\\nstand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and\\r\\nnow going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell\\r\\nthick on one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose\\r\\nto speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future; so\\r\\nhe spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they\\r\\nhave; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the\\r\\nfolly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their\\r\\nhearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the wife of a chieftain who they\\r\\nthought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell\\r\\nyou. Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing\\r\\ndown evil on your own heads.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left\\r\\nthe assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of\\r\\nHalitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore\\r\\nhurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met\\r\\ntogether in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He\\r\\nthought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was\\r\\nnever to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me\\r\\nthis question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting still\\r\\nfurther, or will you make peace between them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own\\r\\narrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do\\r\\nwhatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most reasonable\\r\\narrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant,\\r\\nin virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to\\r\\nforgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all\\r\\nbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from\\r\\noff the topmost summits of Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, “Some\\r\\nof you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us.” So one of\\r\\nDolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them\\r\\nall quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here they are, let us put on our armour\\r\\nat once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could—that is to say Ulysses, his\\r\\nthree men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did the\\r\\nsame—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they had all put\\r\\non their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form and voice\\r\\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show\\r\\nevery man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent\\r\\nfor their strength and courage all the world over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall see, if\\r\\nyou will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed, “what a\\r\\nday I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying\\r\\nwith one another in the matter of valour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius—-best friend I\\r\\nhave in the world—pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove her father; then\\r\\npoise your spear and hurl it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed to her\\r\\nhe poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went\\r\\nright through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armour rang rattling\\r\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell\\r\\nupon the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears;\\r\\nindeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever\\r\\ngetting home again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one\\r\\npause. “Men of Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the\\r\\nmatter at once without further bloodshed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms\\r\\ndropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess’\\r\\nvoice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But Ulysses gave a great\\r\\ncry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the\\r\\nson of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so\\r\\nshe said to Ulysses, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife,\\r\\nor Jove will be angry with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed the\\r\\nform and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace between the\\r\\ntwo contending parties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]\\r\\n [ Black races are evidently known to the writer as stretching all across\\r\\n Africa, one half looking West on to the Atlantic, and the other East on to the\\r\\n Indian Ocean.]\\n---------new doc---------\\n[61]\\r\\n [ This is hidden malice, implying that the Phaeacian magnates were no better\\r\\n than they should be.

The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and Charybdis, and the\\r\\n alternative between them and something untold merges into the alternative\\r\\n whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or Charybdis. Yet from line 260, it\\r\\n seems we are to consider the Wanderers as having been passed by Ulysses; this\\r\\n appears even more plainly from xxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions\\r\\n the Wandering rocks as having been between the Sirens and Scylla and\\r\\n Charybdis.

Howbeit Poseidon had\\r\\nnow departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in\\r\\ntwain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where\\r\\nhe rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he\\r\\nmade merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls\\r\\nof Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak,\\r\\nfor he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of\\r\\nAgamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the\\r\\nImmortals:\\r\\n    ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say\\r\\ncomes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own\\r\\nhearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\\r\\nbeyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of\\r\\nAtreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his\\r\\neyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\\r\\nslayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the\\r\\nson of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come\\r\\nto man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed\\r\\nnot on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one\\r\\nprice for all.’\\r\\n    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our\\r\\nfather Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death\\r\\nthat is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is\\r\\nrent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long\\r\\nwhile suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a\\r\\nwoodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\\r\\nwizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall\\r\\npillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the\\r\\nhapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him\\r\\nto forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the\\r\\nsmoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\\r\\nheart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of\\r\\nthe Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land?\\r\\nWherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\\r\\n“Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\\r\\nmarginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this end in my MS. I\\r\\nfound, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly scholasticised,\\r\\nand abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on those who have the\\r\\nmanagement of our University presses, that they would render a great service to\\r\\nstudents if they would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic\\r\\npassages printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have\\r\\ngiven the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages\\r\\nunderlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked with all\\r\\nthe Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of both the “Iliad” and\\r\\n“Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAny one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round\\r\\nthe “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his reader’s mind\\r\\nthat the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood, and\\r\\nhence (even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion) presumably by one\\r\\nperson only—that it was written certainly before 750, and in all probability\\r\\nbefore 1000 B.C.—that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably\\r\\nfamiliar with the “Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those\\r\\nbooks whose genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are\\r\\nadmitted to be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his\\r\\nreaders, is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who\\r\\nwill mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British Museum\\r\\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common sense can\\r\\ndraw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems, will, I\\r\\nbelieve, find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number\\r\\nof books here and on the Continent that at present enjoy considerable\\r\\nreputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps is an advantage better worth\\r\\nsecuring, he will find that many puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him\\r\\non the discovery that they arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOther difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the poem\\r\\nin the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some length in\\r\\npp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly, the “Odyssey” consists\\r\\nof two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked\\r\\nto sing in the opening lines of the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian\\r\\nepisode, and the account of Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books\\r\\nix.-xii. It consists of lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v.,\\r\\nand thence without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at\\r\\nwhich point the original scheme was abandoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of Telemachus’\\r\\nvoyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of Book i., is\\r\\ncontinued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till Ulysses wakes in the\\r\\nmiddle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it continues to the end of Book\\r\\nxxiv.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on\\r\\nand on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When\\r\\nthey were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,\\r\\nbeating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that\\r\\nwere below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off\\r\\ntowards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and\\r\\nasked each other what all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\\r\\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all\\r\\nhonesty, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I\\r\\nsee mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away much longer;\\r\\nindeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them\\r\\nalone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in\\r\\ntime, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so\\r\\nof their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying\\r\\nwithout due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when\\r\\nthe Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through\\r\\nmuch hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\\r\\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to your\\r\\nown children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much\\r\\nbetter than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or\\r\\nother, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in a far country, and it\\r\\nis a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens\\r\\nand adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I\\r\\nsuppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell\\r\\nyou—and it shall surely be—when an old man like you, who should know better,\\r\\ntalks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his\\r\\nyoung friend will only fare so much the worse—he will take nothing by it, for\\r\\nthe suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir,\\r\\nupon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon\\r\\nyou. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his\\r\\nmother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all\\r\\nthe marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on\\r\\nharassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with\\r\\nall his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as\\r\\nmuch as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and\\r\\ncontinue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till such time as\\r\\nhis mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe\\r\\nof expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare\\r\\nperfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\\r\\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more,\\r\\nand entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my\\r\\nstory. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and\\r\\nthither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so\\r\\nlong been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear\\r\\nthings in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of\\r\\nhim as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\\r\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I\\r\\nwill return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\\r\\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor[20] who had been a friend of Ulysses, and\\r\\nhad been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants,\\r\\nrose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\\r\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I hope\\r\\nthat all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one\\r\\nof you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father.\\r\\nI am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in\\r\\nthe naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not\\r\\nreturn, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you\\r\\nothers I am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying\\r\\nto stop such scandalous goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you are\\r\\nmany and they are few.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is all\\r\\nthis, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man\\r\\nto fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set\\r\\nupon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his\\r\\nwife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing,\\r\\nand his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds.\\r\\nThere is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people\\r\\ngo about your business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and\\r\\nHalitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I do not\\r\\nthink he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\\r\\nand tells him something.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode,\\r\\nwhile the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey\\r\\nwaves, and prayed to Minerva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the\\r\\nseas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but\\r\\nthe Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I\\r\\ncannot do so.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the\\r\\nvoice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of the same stuff as\\r\\nyour father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never\\r\\nbroke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your\\r\\nvoyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of\\r\\nPenelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom\\r\\nas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\\r\\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not\\r\\nentirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look with hope\\r\\nupon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those\\r\\nfoolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to\\r\\ndeath and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that\\r\\nthey shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long\\r\\ndelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a\\r\\nship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\\r\\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see\\r\\neverything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the\\r\\nstaff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up\\r\\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run\\r\\nmy eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and\\r\\nwill put out to sea without delay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as\\r\\nthe goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the suitors flaying goats\\r\\nand singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once and\\r\\nlaughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, “Telemachus, my fine\\r\\nfire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink\\r\\nwith us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and\\r\\na picked crew to boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news\\r\\nof your noble father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of\\r\\nany kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so\\r\\nmuch good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know\\r\\nmore about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by\\r\\ngoing to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will\\r\\nnot be in vain—though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of\\r\\nmy own, and must be passenger not captain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others\\r\\nwent on getting dinner ready about the buildings,[21] jeering at him tauntingly as they did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I suppose he\\r\\nthinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where\\r\\nhe seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in\\r\\nour wine and kill us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his\\r\\nfather and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to\\r\\ndo, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we\\r\\ncan let his mother and the man who marries her have that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious\\r\\nstore-room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon\\r\\nthe floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests.\\r\\nHere, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old,\\r\\nwell-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against\\r\\nthe wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all. The room was closed\\r\\nwith well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old\\r\\nhouse-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of\\r\\neverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping\\r\\nfor my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and\\r\\nfind his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they\\r\\nall have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal—about\\r\\ntwenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing\\r\\nabout it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has\\r\\ngone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can\\r\\nhear anything about the return of my dear father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, “My\\r\\ndear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in\\r\\nthe world do you want to go to—you, who are the one hope of the house? Your\\r\\npoor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as\\r\\nsoon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you\\r\\nput out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay\\r\\nwhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your\\r\\nlife out on the barren ocean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without heaven’s\\r\\nsanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till\\r\\nI have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone,\\r\\nand asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had\\r\\ncompleted her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the\\r\\nbarley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went\\r\\nround the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by\\r\\nsundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let her have\\r\\na ship—which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was\\r\\nover all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board\\r\\nher that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour.\\r\\nPresently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep\\r\\nslumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups\\r\\nfrom their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back\\r\\ninto the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she\\r\\ntook the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for\\r\\nyou to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\\r\\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus by the\\r\\nhand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going to be a great hero some\\r\\nday, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can\\r\\nhave been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable\\r\\ndaughter, the Trito-born, who shewed such favour towards your brave father\\r\\namong the Argives. Holy queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace\\r\\nupon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in\\r\\nsacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\\r\\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in\\r\\nsacrifice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own\\r\\nhouse, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got there and had\\r\\ntaken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine\\r\\nthat was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that\\r\\nheld it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to\\r\\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink\\r\\nofferings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to\\r\\nbed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that\\r\\nwas over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now\\r\\nleft him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\\r\\nqueen his wife by his side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left his\\r\\ncouch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood\\r\\nin front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but\\r\\nhe was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat\\r\\nsceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their\\r\\nrooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and\\r\\nThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them\\r\\nthey made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and\\r\\nforemost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested herself\\r\\nvisibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to\\r\\nthe plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it\\r\\nat once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship, and invite all the crew, leaving\\r\\ntwo men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus\\r\\nthe goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where\\r\\nyou are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to\\r\\nfetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me\\r\\nsome clear spring water.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in\\r\\nfrom the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought\\r\\nthe anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva\\r\\nherself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith\\r\\ngilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their\\r\\nbeauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched\\r\\nwater from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his\\r\\nother hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\\r\\nsharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor\\r\\nbegan with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered\\r\\nmany a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer’s head upon the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal[32] Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and\\r\\nbrought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base\\r\\nof her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his\\r\\nvenerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\\r\\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer’s head from off the ground, and\\r\\nPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they\\r\\ncut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round\\r\\nin two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then\\r\\nNestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young\\r\\nmen stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were\\r\\nburned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up\\r\\nsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When\\r\\nshe had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and\\r\\nshirt,[33] and he\\r\\nlooked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of\\r\\nNestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat\\r\\ndown to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\\r\\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to\\r\\neat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to the chariot that\\r\\nhe may start at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses\\r\\nto the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and\\r\\nsweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot,\\r\\nwhile Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed\\r\\nthe horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving\\r\\nthe high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying\\r\\nthe yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\r\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\\r\\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they\\r\\nagain yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\\r\\ngatehouse.[34]\\r\\nPisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently\\r\\nthey came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time\\r\\ncompleted their journey, so well did their steeds take them.[35]\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK IV\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY—MEANWHILE THE SUITORS IN ITHACA\\r\\nPLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who have come\\r\\nto visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help saying what I\\r\\nthink. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed\\r\\nwhen I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like\\r\\nTelemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to\\r\\nTroy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do. His hands\\r\\nand feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape of his head and\\r\\nthe expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses, and\\r\\nsaying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he\\r\\nhid his face in his mantle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that\\r\\nthis young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come\\r\\nhere and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely\\r\\ninteresting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for\\r\\nhe wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son\\r\\nhas always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without\\r\\nsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\\r\\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from the son\\r\\nof a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake. I had always\\r\\nhoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us\\r\\na safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in\\r\\nArgos, and built him a house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his\\r\\ngoods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of\\r\\nthe neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one\\r\\nanother continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and\\r\\nhappy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\\r\\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept, Telemachus\\r\\nwept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his eyes from filling,\\r\\nwhen he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom the son of bright Dawn had\\r\\nkilled. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you\\r\\nwere a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do\\r\\nas I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper.\\r\\nMorning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry\\r\\nfor those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We\\r\\ncan only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a\\r\\nbrother who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\\r\\nto have known him—his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself,\\r\\nbut they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years. It is\\r\\nplain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one\\r\\nwhom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring—and it has blessed\\r\\nNestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own\\r\\nhouse, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put\\r\\nan end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water\\r\\nbe poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\\r\\nthe morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they\\r\\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the\\r\\nwine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever\\r\\ndrinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not\\r\\neven though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a\\r\\nbrother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of such\\r\\nsovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon,\\r\\na woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into\\r\\nthe mixing bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country\\r\\nis a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put\\r\\nthis drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable men\\r\\n(which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do\\r\\nwhat he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in\\r\\nseason. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I\\r\\ncan say what he did when he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts\\r\\nof difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself\\r\\nall in rags, and entered the enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar,\\r\\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people. In this\\r\\ndisguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\\r\\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When,\\r\\nhowever, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I\\r\\nhad sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely\\r\\nback to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant\\r\\nto do. He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\\r\\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my\\r\\nown part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I\\r\\nwas unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,\\r\\naway from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by\\r\\nno means deficient either in person or understanding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I\\r\\nhave travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I have never seen\\r\\nsuch another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and what courage he displayed\\r\\nwithin the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in\\r\\nwait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.[43] At that moment you came up to us;\\r\\nsome god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\\r\\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat\\r\\nit; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our\\r\\nwives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made.\\r\\nDiomed and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there,\\r\\nor to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite\\r\\nstill, all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses\\r\\nclapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\\r\\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save him,\\r\\nnor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed,\\r\\nthat we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the\\r\\ngatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top\\r\\nof them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out,\\r\\ncarrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted\\r\\nthe strangers. Thus, then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the\\r\\nforecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by\\r\\nhis side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then,\\r\\ntaking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?\\r\\nAre you on public, or private business? Tell me all about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me anything\\r\\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is\\r\\nbeing wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers\\r\\nof my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother.\\r\\nTherefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my\\r\\nfather’s melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it\\r\\nfrom some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften\\r\\nthings out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\\r\\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\\r\\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as\\r\\nin my favour and tell me truly all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed, “these\\r\\ncowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay her new born\\r\\nyoung in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some\\r\\ngrassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with\\r\\nthe pair of them—and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove,\\r\\nMinerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled\\r\\nwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans\\r\\ncheered him—if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would\\r\\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I\\r\\nwill not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\\r\\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my\\r\\nhecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict\\r\\nabout having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a\\r\\nday with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos—it\\r\\nhas a good harbour from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have\\r\\ntaken in water—and here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a\\r\\nbreath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of\\r\\nprovisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon\\r\\nme and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of\\r\\nthe sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used\\r\\nto go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of catching a\\r\\nfish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. ‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it\\r\\nseems to me that you like starving in this way—at any rate it does not greatly\\r\\ntrouble you, for you stick here day after day, without even trying to get away\\r\\nthough your men are dying by inches.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be,\\r\\nthat I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods\\r\\nthat live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything, which of\\r\\nthe immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I\\r\\nmay sail the sea so as to reach my home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an\\r\\nold immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is Proteus. He\\r\\nis an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune’s head man and\\r\\nknows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him\\r\\nand hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to\\r\\ntake, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also\\r\\ntell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both good\\r\\nand bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may catch this\\r\\nold god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a god is not easily\\r\\ncaught—not by a mortal man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time\\r\\nwhen the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea comes up\\r\\nfrom under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water over his\\r\\nhead. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to sleep in a great sea\\r\\ncave, where the seals—Halosydne’s chickens as they call them—come up also from\\r\\nthe grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and\\r\\nfish-like smell do they bring with them. [44] Early to-morrow morning I will take\\r\\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three\\r\\nbest men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the\\r\\nold man will play you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen\\r\\nthem and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them, as a\\r\\nshepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep seize him; put\\r\\nforth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to\\r\\nget away from you. He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes\\r\\nupon the earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him\\r\\nfast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes\\r\\nback to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your\\r\\nhold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry\\r\\nwith you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place\\r\\nwhere my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care\\r\\nas I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was\\r\\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into\\r\\nthin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid\\r\\nhad been her dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent\\r\\non murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great\\r\\nsize, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either\\r\\nside of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in\\r\\nambush.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK V\\n\\r\\nCALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike\\r\\nto mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord\\r\\nof thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many\\r\\nsufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph\\r\\nCalypso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in everlasting\\r\\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler\\r\\nany more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth\\r\\ncruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten\\r\\nUlysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in\\r\\ngreat pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him\\r\\ngo; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships\\r\\nnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying\\r\\nto murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and\\r\\nLacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you not send\\r\\nhim there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to get home and\\r\\npunish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telemachus, and\\r\\nto see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying\\r\\nback without having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are our\\r\\nmessenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is\\r\\nto return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a\\r\\nperilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria,[50] the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he\\r\\nwere one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and\\r\\nwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back\\r\\nfrom Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\\r\\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was\\r\\ntold. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could\\r\\nfly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s\\r\\neyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand\\r\\nover Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the\\r\\nlevel of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing\\r\\nevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the\\r\\nspray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\\r\\nisland which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he\\r\\ncame to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one\\r\\ncould smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for\\r\\nherself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp\\r\\nand singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder,\\r\\npoplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had\\r\\nbuilt their nests—owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their\\r\\nbusiness in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew\\r\\nluxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\\r\\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so\\r\\nas to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed.\\r\\n[51] Even a god\\r\\ncould not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still\\r\\nand looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the\\r\\ncave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, no matter how far\\r\\nthey live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was on the sea-shore\\r\\nas usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning\\r\\nand breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: “Why\\r\\nhave you come to see me, Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you do not\\r\\nvisit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and\\r\\nif it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him\\r\\nsome red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I have come\\r\\nhere, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove sent me; it was\\r\\nno doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea\\r\\nwhere there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice\\r\\nhecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross\\r\\nJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most\\r\\nill-starred of all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam\\r\\nand sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way home\\r\\nthey sinned against Minerva,[52] who raised both wind and waves\\r\\nagainst them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\\r\\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at\\r\\nonce, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people,\\r\\nbut shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him\\r\\nfrom the island after washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave\\r\\nhim a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also\\r\\ngave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat.\\r\\nMoreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses\\r\\nspread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means\\r\\nof the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on\\r\\nlate-setting Bootes, and on the Bear—which men also call the wain, and which\\r\\nturns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into\\r\\nthe stream of Oceanus—for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days\\r\\nseven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\\r\\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising\\r\\nlike a shield on the horizon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\\r\\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him\\r\\nsailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and\\r\\nmuttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods have been changing\\r\\ntheir minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he is close to\\r\\nthe land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the\\r\\ncalamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet\\r\\nbefore he has done with it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round\\r\\nin the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and\\r\\nsky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from\\r\\nEast, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a\\r\\ntremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart began to fail him. “Alas,” he\\r\\nsaid to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me? I am afraid\\r\\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back\\r\\nhome. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds,\\r\\nand what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe\\r\\nto perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in\\r\\nthe cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when\\r\\nthe Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\\r\\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name;\\r\\nbut now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled\\r\\nagain, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the\\r\\nforce of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and\\r\\nboth sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Ulysses was under\\r\\nwater, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes\\r\\nCalypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\\r\\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In\\r\\nspite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast\\r\\nas he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to\\r\\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\\r\\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the South,\\r\\nNorth, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea, saw\\r\\nhim. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank\\r\\nof a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses now was, she had\\r\\ncompassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat\\r\\nupon the raft.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with you? He\\r\\nis giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill\\r\\nyou. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave your\\r\\nraft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast where better\\r\\nluck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round your chest; it is\\r\\nenchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you\\r\\ntouch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\\r\\ngo away again.” With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then\\r\\nshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in his\\r\\ndismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by\\r\\nadvising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the\\r\\nland where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good\\r\\nway off. I know what I will do—I am sure it will be best—no matter what happens\\r\\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea\\r\\nbreaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that seemed\\r\\nto rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft, which then\\r\\nwent to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a\\r\\nwhirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on\\r\\nhorseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino’s veil\\r\\nunder his arms, and plunged into the sea—meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune\\r\\nwatched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\\r\\n“There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do\\r\\npeople. I do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\\r\\nlightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the winds\\r\\nexcept one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze\\r\\nfrom the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses reached the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians where he would be safe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy\\r\\nswell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day\\r\\nbroke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of\\r\\nair stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see\\r\\nland quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father begins to get\\r\\nbetter after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some\\r\\nangry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when\\r\\nhe again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\\r\\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he\\r\\nbegan to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still\\r\\nbroke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\\r\\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but\\r\\nonly headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\\n---------new doc---------\\nUlysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself,\\r\\n“Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all\\r\\nhope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,\\r\\nthe rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under\\r\\nthem so that I cannot climb out for want of foot hold. I am afraid some great\\r\\nwave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\\r\\nwater—which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim\\r\\nfurther in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me\\r\\nout to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster\\r\\nof the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\\r\\nNeptune is very angry with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force\\r\\nagainst the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Minerva\\r\\nhad not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and\\r\\nclung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that\\r\\ntime; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with it far\\r\\ninto the sea—tearing his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some\\r\\none plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it—even so did\\r\\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep\\r\\ndown under the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\\r\\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam\\r\\nseaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and\\r\\nat the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some\\r\\nhaven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on,\\r\\nhe came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best place,\\r\\nfor there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that\\r\\nthere was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god\\r\\nNeptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost his way has at\\r\\nall times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to\\r\\nyour stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O\\r\\nking, for I declare myself your suppliant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before\\r\\nhim, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Ulysses’\\r\\nknees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him. His\\r\\nbody was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with\\r\\nsea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from\\r\\nsheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to himself\\r\\nagain, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the\\r\\nsalt[54] stream of\\r\\nthe river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it\\r\\ntowards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and\\r\\nkissed the bounteous earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me, and\\r\\nhow is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the long\\r\\nwatches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make\\r\\nan end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the\\r\\nriver. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods,\\r\\nand sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night’s rest,\\r\\nbut some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some\\r\\nhigh ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive\\r\\nthat grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted sucker, while the other had\\r\\nbeen grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they\\r\\nafforded, nor could the sun’s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them,\\r\\nso closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began\\r\\nto make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves\\r\\nlying about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter\\r\\nweather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the\\r\\nleaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any\\r\\nneighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having\\r\\nto get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and\\r\\nMinerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\\r\\nall memories of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VI\\n\\r\\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the\\r\\ncountry and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in the fair town\\r\\nof Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger than\\r\\nthey and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved them thence and settled\\r\\nthem in Scheria, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall,\\r\\nbuilt houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was\\r\\ndead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\\r\\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\\r\\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a\\r\\ngirl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alcinous. Two\\r\\nmaid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side of\\r\\nthe doorway, which was closed with well made folding doors. Minerva took the\\r\\nform of the famous sea captain Dymas’s daughter, who was a bosom friend of\\r\\nNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a\\r\\nbreath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter?\\r\\nHere are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married\\r\\nalmost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should\\r\\nfind good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a\\r\\ngood name, and to make your father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that\\r\\nwe make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you\\r\\nso that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\\r\\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going to\\r\\nremain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and\\r\\nmules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\\r\\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the\\r\\nwashing-cisterns are some way from the town.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is the\\r\\neverlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor\\r\\nsnow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great\\r\\npeacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and\\r\\never. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given\\r\\ninstructions to the girl.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met,\\r\\nand I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let\\r\\nme have anything that you may have brought hither to wrap your clothes in. May\\r\\nheaven grant you in all things your heart’s desire—husband, house, and a happy,\\r\\npeaceful home; for there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife\\r\\nshould be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts\\r\\nof their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\r\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives prosperity to\\r\\nrich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send\\r\\nyou, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our\\r\\ncountry, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner\\r\\nin distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and\\r\\nwill tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am\\r\\ndaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not\\r\\nsee a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a\\r\\nmurderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any\\r\\nharm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land’s end that juts\\r\\ninto the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any other people. This is\\r\\nonly some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for\\r\\nstrangers and foreigners in distress are under Jove’s protection, and will take\\r\\nwhat they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\\r\\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back.\\r\\nThey made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and\\r\\nbrought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of\\r\\noil, and told him to go and wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, “Young women,\\r\\nplease to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine from my\\r\\nshoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has\\r\\nhad a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing\\r\\nthere. I am ashamed to strip[56] before a number of good looking young\\r\\nwomen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses washed\\r\\nhimself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad\\r\\nshoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of\\r\\nhis hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl\\r\\nhad given him; Minerva then made him look taller and stronger than before, she\\r\\nalso made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls\\r\\nlike hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a\\r\\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\\r\\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty.\\r\\nThen he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young\\r\\nand handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her\\r\\nmaids:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in\\r\\nheaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him\\r\\nplain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I\\r\\nshould like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would\\r\\nonly stay here and not want to go away. However, give him something to eat and\\r\\ndrink.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and drank\\r\\nravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile,\\r\\nNausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed\\r\\nin the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called\\r\\nUlysses:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\\r\\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that\\r\\nyou will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I\\r\\nbid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the\\r\\nfields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids\\r\\nand I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the town,\\r\\nwhere you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on\\r\\neither side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\\r\\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You\\r\\nwill see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and\\r\\npaved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship’s gear of\\r\\nall kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars\\r\\nare made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing\\r\\nabout bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their\\r\\nmasts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later\\r\\non; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met\\r\\nus, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with\\r\\nNausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps\\r\\nhe is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we\\r\\nhave no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to\\r\\nher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It\\r\\nwould be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband\\r\\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young\\r\\nPhaeacians who are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark\\r\\nthat would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be\\r\\nscandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in\\r\\nspite of everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\\r\\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you are\\r\\nunskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I suppose\\r\\nyou are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or\\r\\nmerchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward\\r\\ncargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent fellow—so\\r\\ntrue is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and\\r\\nunderstanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this\\r\\nwith such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his\\r\\nhoneyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all\\r\\nassemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may\\r\\nbe as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\\r\\nThis is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but\\r\\nyou are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you\\r\\nare quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\\r\\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.\\r\\nNow, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much\\r\\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite\\r\\nof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger,\\r\\nmore massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when\\r\\ndisc-throwing among themselves.[68] Then, swinging it back, he threw it\\r\\nfrom his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The\\r\\nPhaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from\\r\\nhis hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form\\r\\nof a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,”\\r\\nsaid she, “could easily tell your mark by groping for it—it is so far ahead of\\r\\nany other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can\\r\\ncome near to such a throw as yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he\\r\\nbegan to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to that throw if\\r\\nyou can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone\\r\\nwants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I\\r\\nwill box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all\\r\\nexcept Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot\\r\\ncompete with one’s own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or\\r\\na sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host’s family at any game,\\r\\nespecially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\\r\\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I\\r\\nwant to have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at\\r\\nevery kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In\\r\\nbattle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how\\r\\nmany more are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man\\r\\nwho could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\\r\\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat\\r\\nbread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the\\r\\nmighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men who could shoot\\r\\nagainst the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by\\r\\nhis end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\\r\\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.\\r\\nRunning is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\\r\\nPhaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my\\r\\nprovisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, “Sir, we have had\\r\\nmuch pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand\\r\\nthat you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some\\r\\ninsolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which\\r\\ncould never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety.\\r\\nI hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief\\r\\nmen who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\\r\\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not\\r\\nparticularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are\\r\\nsingularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of\\r\\ngood dinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm\\r\\nbaths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set\\r\\nabout dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his\\r\\nfriends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, and\\r\\nminstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of\\r\\nyou and fetch it for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king’s house, and the\\r\\nnine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business\\r\\nto manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth\\r\\nand marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently the servant came back with\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best\\r\\nyoung dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was\\r\\ndelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how they\\r\\nfirst began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus many\\r\\npresents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who saw what they\\r\\nwere about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful\\r\\nnews, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its\\r\\nplace, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break,\\r\\nso that they might stay there in that place.[69] When he had finished his snare he\\r\\nwent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\\r\\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not\\r\\neven a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had\\r\\nspread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\\r\\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one he was\\r\\nmost fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start,\\r\\nhurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about\\r\\nsitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in\\r\\nhis own, “Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, but is gone off\\r\\nto Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon\\r\\nthey were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for them, and\\r\\ncould neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were\\r\\nin a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching\\r\\nLemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious\\r\\npassion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to\\r\\nall the gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” he cried, “and all you other blessed gods who live for ever,\\r\\ncome here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you.\\r\\nJove’s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am lame. She is in\\r\\nlove with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple—but my\\r\\nparents are to blame for that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me.\\r\\nCome and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at\\r\\nthem. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there\\r\\nlonger than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\\r\\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for\\r\\nhis baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune\\r\\ncame, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses staid\\r\\nat home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in the\\r\\ndoorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they\\r\\nsaw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping\\r\\nVulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god in heaven; and\\r\\nnow Mars will be cast in heavy damages.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, “Messenger Mercury,\\r\\ngiver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you,\\r\\nif you could sleep with Venus?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Apollo,” answered Mercury, “I only wish I might get the chance, though\\r\\nthere were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all of you, gods\\r\\nand goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all\\r\\nseriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again. “Let him go,”\\r\\nhe cried, “and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the\\r\\ndamages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not,” replied Vulcan, “ask me to do this; a bad man’s bond is bad security;\\r\\nwhat remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away and leave his\\r\\ndebts behind him along with his chains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will\\r\\npay you myself.” So Vulcan answered, “In this case I cannot and must not refuse\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they\\r\\nscampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to Cyprus and to\\r\\nPaphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here\\r\\nthe Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the\\r\\nimmortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most\\r\\nenchanting beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed\\r\\nas they heard him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to\\r\\ncompete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and\\r\\none of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while\\r\\nthe other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came\\r\\ndown again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they\\r\\nbegan to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards\\r\\nto one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great\\r\\nstamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world,\\r\\nand indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement; let us\\r\\ngive him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are\\r\\ntwelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,\\r\\neach of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him\\r\\nall this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so\\r\\nwith a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\r\\npresent too, for he has been rude.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their\\r\\nservants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King Alcinous, I will give\\r\\nthe stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have my sword, which is\\r\\nof bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the\\r\\nscabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal\\r\\nto him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good luck to\\r\\nyou, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it\\r\\naway with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you\\r\\nhave been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo which Ulysses answered, “Good luck to you too my friend, and may the gods\\r\\ngrant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me\\r\\nalong with your apology.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown\\r\\nthe presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept\\r\\nbringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons received them, and\\r\\nplaced them under their mother’s charge. Then Alcinous led the way to the house\\r\\nand bade his guests take their seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we have, and\\r\\nput a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some\\r\\nwater; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the\\r\\npresents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy\\r\\nboth his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this\\r\\ngolden goblet—which is of exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me\\r\\nfor the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any\\r\\nof the gods.”[70]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they\\r\\ncould, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they\\r\\nthrew on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\\r\\nabout the belly of the tripod.[71] Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent\\r\\nchest from her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of\\r\\ngold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and\\r\\na good shirt from Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:\\n---------new doc---------\\n“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His\\r\\ngreat neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.\\r\\nPresently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh\\r\\non which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of\\r\\nwood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them\\r\\nshould turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to\\r\\nblaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round\\r\\nme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of\\r\\nthe beam into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept\\r\\nturning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s plank\\r\\nwith an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\\r\\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the\\r\\nboiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the\\r\\nsteam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots\\r\\nof the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\\r\\ninto cold water to temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and\\r\\nit makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round\\r\\nthe beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran\\r\\naway in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his\\r\\neye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so\\r\\nto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they\\r\\ngathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\\r\\nwhat was the matter with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking\\r\\nthe stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely\\r\\nno man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either\\r\\nby fraud or by force?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing me by\\r\\nfraud; no man is killing me by force.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove\\r\\nmakes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your\\r\\nfather Neptune.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\\r\\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with\\r\\nhis hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the\\r\\ndoorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with\\r\\nthe sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life\\r\\nand those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his\\r\\nlife depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nthis plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown, and carried a\\r\\nheavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some\\r\\nof the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man\\r\\nunder the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\\r\\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than\\r\\nany of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the\\r\\nthick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards,\\r\\nkeeping a firm hold on it all the time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to\\r\\nfeed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for\\r\\ntheir udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain\\r\\nfelt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp\\r\\nenough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was\\r\\ngoing out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\\r\\nself, Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\\r\\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with\\r\\na run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come\\r\\nhome again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your\\r\\nmaster has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid\\r\\ncrew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life\\r\\nyet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is\\r\\nhiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the\\r\\ncave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has\\r\\ndone me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from\\r\\nthe cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly, and then freed my\\r\\ncomrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in\\r\\nthe right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew\\r\\nrejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the\\r\\nothers whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding\\r\\nand frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\\r\\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their\\r\\nplaces, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out\\r\\nas my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man before\\r\\neating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your visitors in your\\r\\nown house? You might have known that your sin would find you out, and now Jove\\r\\nand the other gods have punished you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a\\r\\nhigh mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a\\r\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder.[81] The sea quaked as the rock fell into\\r\\nit, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland,\\r\\nand forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the\\r\\nship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for\\r\\ntheir lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as\\r\\nwe were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and\\r\\nprayed of me to hold my tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\\r\\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the\\r\\nmainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard\\r\\nany further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship’s\\r\\ntimbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he\\r\\ncan throw them a long way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, ‘Cyclops,\\r\\nif any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty,\\r\\nsay it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncovered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought\\r\\nher by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’\\r\\nsaid I, ‘please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my\\r\\nhomeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering\\r\\nme with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the goddess answered, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of\\r\\nyou stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey\\r\\nwhich you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the ghost of the blind Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, whose reason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine\\r\\nleft his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about\\r\\naimlessly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly\\r\\nhave lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was\\r\\ntired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon\\r\\nthis voyage—for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise your mast, set your white\\r\\nsails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of itself. When\\r\\nyour ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore\\r\\nof Proserpine’s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed\\r\\ntheir fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go\\r\\nstraight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where\\r\\nthe rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)\\r\\nflow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring\\r\\nrivers run into one another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or\\r\\nso in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all\\r\\nthe dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place\\r\\nwater—sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many\\r\\nprayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to\\r\\nIthaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will\\r\\nload the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\\r\\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your\\r\\nflocks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a\\r\\nram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away\\r\\nfrom them as though you would make towards the river. On this, many dead men’s\\r\\nghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that\\r\\nyou have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades\\r\\nand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any\\r\\nother poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have\\r\\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you\\r\\nabout your voyage—what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea\\r\\nso as to reach your home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my\\r\\nshirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric\\r\\nover her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she\\r\\ncovered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men everywhere all\\r\\nover the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man by man: ‘You must not lie\\r\\nsleeping here any longer,’ said I to them, ‘we must be going, for Circe has\\r\\ntold me all about it.’ And on this they did as I bade them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had with us\\r\\na certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who\\r\\nhad got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to\\r\\nsleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men bustling\\r\\nabout, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main\\r\\nstaircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul\\r\\nwent down to the house of Hades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had got the men together I said to them, ‘You think you are about to\\r\\nstart home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have\\r\\ngot to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the\\r\\nground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by\\r\\ncrying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe\\r\\nbrought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She passed\\r\\nthrough the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and\\r\\ngoings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XI\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO THE DEAD.[88]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water\\r\\nand got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took\\r\\nour places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and\\r\\ncunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with\\r\\nus keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing\\r\\nto the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day\\r\\nlong her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of\\r\\nthe river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\\r\\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither\\r\\nat his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor\\r\\nwretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the\\r\\nship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till\\r\\nwe came to the place of which Circe had told us.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug\\r\\nthe trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first\\r\\nwith honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled\\r\\nwhite barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless\\r\\nghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a\\r\\nbarren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good\\r\\nthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep\\r\\nto himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the\\r\\ndead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench,\\r\\nwhereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus—brides,[89] young bachelors, old men worn out\\r\\nwith toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been\\r\\nkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from\\r\\nevery quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming\\r\\nsound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men\\r\\nto be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt\\r\\nofferings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to\\r\\nProserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the\\r\\npoor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet\\r\\nbeen laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and unburied in\\r\\nCirce’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for him,\\r\\nand cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how did you come down here into\\r\\nthis gloom and darkness? You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my\\r\\nship.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable\\r\\ndrunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s house, and never thought\\r\\nof coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof and\\r\\nbroke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech\\r\\nyou by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by\\r\\nyour wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child, and by\\r\\nTelemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I\\r\\nknow that when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the\\r\\nAeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or\\r\\nI may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have,\\r\\nbuild a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\\r\\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row\\r\\nwith when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’ And I said, ‘My poor fellow,\\r\\nI will do all that you have asked of me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side\\r\\nof the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade\\r\\nsaying all this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost of my dead\\r\\nmother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her alive when I set out for\\r\\nTroy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I\\r\\nwould not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of\\r\\nTeiresias.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre in his\\r\\nhand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have\\r\\nyou left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?\\r\\nStand back from the trench and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the\\r\\nblood and answer your questions truly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood\\r\\nhe began with his prophecy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will make\\r\\nthis hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of Neptune, who\\r\\nstill nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son. Still,\\r\\nafter much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your\\r\\ncompanions when your ship reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find\\r\\nthe sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of\\r\\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm\\r\\nthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\\r\\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing\\r\\nall your men, [in another man’s ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\\r\\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your substance\\r\\nunder the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and after you\\r\\nhave killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must take a well made\\r\\noar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where the people have\\r\\nnever heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food, nor do they\\r\\nknow anything about ships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will\\r\\ngive you this certain token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will\\r\\nmeet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\\r\\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a\\r\\nbull, and a boar to Neptune.[90] Then go home and offer hecatombs to\\r\\nall the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come\\r\\nto you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\\r\\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I have\\r\\nsaid will come true].’[91]\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me\\r\\nand tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she is sitting by\\r\\nthe blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not\\r\\nremember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood\\r\\nwill talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any\\r\\nblood they will go away again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\\r\\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother\\r\\ncame up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me,\\r\\nsaying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are\\r\\nstill alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between\\r\\nus and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\\r\\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all\\r\\nthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got\\r\\nback to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Neptune.\\r\\nShe bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. They were the\\r\\nfinest children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking, Orion\\r\\nonly excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured\\r\\nnine cubits round the chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in\\r\\nOlympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount\\r\\nPelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would\\r\\nhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\\r\\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks\\r\\nor chin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician\\r\\nMinos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but he did not enjoy\\r\\nher, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the island of Dia on account\\r\\nof what Bacchus had said against her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband\\r\\nfor gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every single one of\\r\\nthe wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to go to\\r\\nbed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and\\r\\nyourselves will see to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\\r\\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good looking,\\r\\nand is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the\\r\\ndistinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the\\r\\npresents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all\\r\\nof you with great abundance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among them, “My\\r\\nfriends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us is both\\r\\nreasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision\\r\\nwhether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still live and\\r\\nreign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home, still\\r\\nwe must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, by which time I shall\\r\\nbe able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his\\r\\nescort it will be a matter for you all, and mine above all others as the chief\\r\\nperson among you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts,\\r\\nI should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage, for I\\r\\nshould return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected\\r\\nand beloved by all who see me when I get back to Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea that you\\r\\nare a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people going about who\\r\\ntell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there\\r\\nis a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition.\\r\\nMoreover you have told the story of your own misfortunes, and those of the\\r\\nArgives, as though you were a practiced bard; but tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nwhether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with\\r\\nyourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it\\r\\nis not yet bed time—go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\\r\\nhere listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us\\r\\nof your adventures.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and a time\\r\\nfor going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not refrain from\\r\\ntelling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall\\r\\nfighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery\\r\\nof a wicked woman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had\\r\\nperished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the\\r\\nblood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to\\r\\nembrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and\\r\\npitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you come by your death,’ said I, ‘King\\r\\nAgamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at\\r\\nsea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were\\r\\ncattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea in any\\r\\nstorm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the mainland, but\\r\\nAegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them. He asked me to\\r\\nhis house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a\\r\\nfat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like\\r\\nsheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some\\r\\ngreat nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\\r\\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable\\r\\nas the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\\r\\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard\\r\\nPriam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I\\r\\nlay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill\\r\\nthe slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close\\r\\nmy lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so\\r\\ncruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers\\r\\nwas. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home\\r\\nby my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace\\r\\non herself and all women who shall come after—even on the good ones.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in\\r\\nthe matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell for Helen’s sake,\\r\\nand now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your\\r\\nabsence.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly even with\\r\\nyour own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell\\r\\nher a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that your wife,\\r\\nUlysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and\\r\\nhas an excellent nature. We left her a young bride with an infant at her breast\\r\\nwhen we set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s\\r\\nestate,[96] and he\\r\\nand his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\\r\\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the\\r\\nhappiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore\\r\\nI say—and lay my saying to your heart—do not tell people when you are bringing\\r\\nyour ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is\\r\\nno trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news\\r\\nof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with\\r\\nMenelaus—for I presume that he is still living.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is\\r\\nalive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not know.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was the finest\\r\\nand goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The fleet\\r\\ndescendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son\\r\\nof Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake next, that you venture down\\r\\nto the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that\\r\\ncan labour no more?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I\\r\\ncame to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my return home\\r\\nto Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to\\r\\nset foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time. As for you,\\r\\nAchilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be,\\r\\nfor you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that\\r\\nyou are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it\\r\\nso much to heart even if you are dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a paid\\r\\nservant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of kings among the\\r\\ndead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a\\r\\ngreat soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about\\r\\nmy father Peleus—does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no\\r\\nrespect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him?\\r\\nCould I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that\\r\\nI had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but\\r\\nbe as I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one who\\r\\ntried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all about\\r\\nyour son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros with the\\r\\nAchaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and\\r\\nhis judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass\\r\\nhim; and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain\\r\\nwith the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all\\r\\nin valour. Many a man did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of\\r\\nthose whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say\\r\\nhow he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\\r\\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell\\r\\naround him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the\\r\\nArgives went inside the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to\\r\\nsettle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it,\\r\\nthough all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their\\r\\neyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear\\r\\nfrom his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the\\r\\nhorse—grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\\r\\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\\r\\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of\\r\\nwar) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat,\\r\\nfor the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow\\r\\nfull of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his\\r\\nson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy\\r\\ntale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still angry with me for\\r\\nhaving won the cause in our dispute about the armour of Achilles. Thetis had\\r\\noffered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges.\\r\\nWould that I had never gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life\\r\\nof Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\\r\\nstature and prowess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not forget and\\r\\nforgive even in death, but must the judgement about that hateful armour still\\r\\nrankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of\\r\\nstrength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son\\r\\nof Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which\\r\\nJove bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your\\r\\ndestruction—come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection,\\r\\nand hear what I can tell you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\\r\\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry,\\r\\nor I should have gone on talking to him,[97] only that there were still others\\r\\namong the dead whom I desired to see.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in\\r\\njudgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round\\r\\nhim in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences upon them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of\\r\\nthe wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great\\r\\nbronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine\\r\\nacres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks\\r\\ninto his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but\\r\\ncould not; for he had violated Jove’s mistress Leto as she was going through\\r\\nPanopeus on her way to Pytho.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his\\r\\nchin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for\\r\\nwhenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that\\r\\nthere was nothing but dry ground—parched by the spite of heaven. There were\\r\\ntall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates,\\r\\napples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched\\r\\nout his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the\\r\\nclouds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both\\r\\nhis hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill,\\r\\nbut always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight\\r\\nwould be too much for him, and the pitiless stone[98] would come thundering down again on\\r\\nto the plain. Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the\\r\\nsweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\\r\\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is\\r\\ndaughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared\\r\\nbirds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare bow in his\\r\\nhands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though ever on the point\\r\\nof taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the\\r\\nmost marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes;\\r\\nthere was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he\\r\\nmight, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once\\r\\nwhen he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor Ulysses, noble son of\\r\\nLaertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was\\r\\nabove ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\\r\\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me—a low fellow who set me all\\r\\nmanner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound—for he did not\\r\\nthink he could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound out\\r\\nof Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I\\r\\nwas in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me. And I should have\\r\\nseen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have\\r\\nseen—Theseus and Pirithous—glorious children of the gods, but so many thousands\\r\\nof ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic\\r\\nstricken lest Proserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of\\r\\nthat awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my\\r\\nmen to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took\\r\\ntheir places, whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We\\r\\nhad to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XII\\n\\r\\nTHE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open sea,\\r\\nwe went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sun-rise\\r\\nas in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on\\r\\nto the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men\\r\\nto Circe’s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood\\r\\nwhere the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and\\r\\nlamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armour had been\\r\\nburned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the\\r\\ncairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her\\r\\nmaid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then she stood\\r\\nin the midst of us and said, ‘You have done a bold thing in going down alive to\\r\\nthe house of Hades, and you will have died twice, to other people’s once; now,\\r\\nthen, stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your\\r\\nvoyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about\\r\\nyour course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering\\r\\nfrom misadventure either by land or sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men\\r\\nlaid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took\\r\\nme by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined\\r\\nby my side and asked me all about our adventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had ended my story, ‘and now pay attention\\r\\nto what I am about to tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your\\r\\nrecollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near\\r\\nthem. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the\\r\\nSirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit\\r\\nin a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song.\\r\\nThere is a great heap of dead men’s bones lying all around, with the flesh\\r\\nstill rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s\\r\\nears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\\r\\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross\\r\\npiece half way up the mast,[99] and they must lash the rope’s ends to\\r\\nthe mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and\\r\\npray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent\\r\\ndirections[100]\\r\\nas to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives\\r\\nbefore you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand there are\\r\\nsome overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat\\r\\nwith terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not\\r\\neven a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to\\r\\nFather Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove\\r\\nhas to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to\\r\\nthese rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\\r\\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that\\r\\never sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of\\r\\nAetes, and she too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Juno\\r\\npiloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark\\r\\ncloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer\\r\\nand early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could get a\\r\\nfoothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had\\r\\nbeen polished. In the middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and\\r\\nturned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so\\r\\nhigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside\\r\\nit Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young\\r\\nhound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one—not even a god—could\\r\\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six\\r\\nnecks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a\\r\\nfrightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together,\\r\\nso that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep\\r\\nwithin her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\\r\\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of\\r\\nthe thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her\\r\\nwithout losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries\\r\\noff a man in each mouth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together that\\r\\nthere is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig tree in full\\r\\nleaf[101] grows\\r\\nupon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in\\r\\nthe day does she vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down\\r\\nagain; see that you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune\\r\\nhimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as\\r\\nfast as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\\r\\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You dare devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to fight\\r\\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\\r\\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude,\\r\\ncruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get\\r\\nby her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock while you are\\r\\nputting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads,\\r\\nand snap up another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full\\r\\nspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla’s dam, bad luck to her;\\r\\nshe will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds\\r\\nof cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god—seven herds of cattle\\r\\nand seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not breed,\\r\\nnor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses\\r\\nPhaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera.\\r\\nTheir mother when she had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to\\r\\nthe Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after\\r\\ntheir father’s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think\\r\\nof nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but\\r\\nif you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\\r\\nof your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will return\\r\\nlate, in bad plight, after losing all your men.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon\\r\\nshe returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose the ship\\r\\nfrom her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, and began\\r\\nto smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and cunning goddess\\r\\nCirce befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily\\r\\nwith us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the\\r\\nship’s gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, ‘My friends, it is not\\r\\nright that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that Circe has\\r\\nmade me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live or die\\r\\nwe may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of the\\r\\nSirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I\\r\\nmight hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind\\r\\nme to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a\\r\\nbond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope’s ends to the\\r\\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly\\r\\nstill.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached the\\r\\nisland of the two Sirens,[102] for the wind had been very\\r\\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\\r\\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them;\\r\\nthen taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in\\r\\nrowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my\\r\\nsword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it\\r\\nsoon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then\\r\\nI stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast\\r\\nas I stood upright on the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\\r\\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate,\\r\\nthe Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come here,’ they sang, ‘renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name, and\\r\\nlisten to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying to hear\\r\\nthe enchanting sweetness of our song—and he who listens will go on his way not\\r\\nonly charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the\\r\\nArgives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you everything that is going to\\r\\nhappen over the whole world.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them further I\\r\\nmade signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free; but they\\r\\nquickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still\\r\\nstronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens’ voices. Then my\\r\\nmen took the wax from their ears and unbound me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from which\\r\\nspray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so frightened\\r\\nthat they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resounded with the\\r\\nrushing of the waters,[103] but the ship stayed where it was,\\r\\nfor the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted them man\\r\\nby man not to lose heart.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in danger,\\r\\nand we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops shut us up in his\\r\\ncave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved us then, and we shall\\r\\nlive to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say,\\r\\ntrust in Jove and row on with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are\\r\\nyour orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away\\r\\nfrom these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\\r\\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla,\\r\\nfor I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together\\r\\nin the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe’s strict instructions—I put\\r\\non my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship’s\\r\\nbows, for it was there that I expected first to see the monster of the rock,\\r\\nwho was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere,\\r\\nthough I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was\\r\\nScylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she\\r\\nvomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon\\r\\na great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When\\r\\nshe began to suck again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and\\r\\nround, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could\\r\\nsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\\r\\nat their wits ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were\\r\\nexpecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and\\r\\nsnatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and\\r\\nin a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the\\r\\nair as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one\\r\\nlast despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting\\r\\nrock[104] throws\\r\\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the\\r\\nox’s horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as\\r\\nhe catches them one by one—even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on\\r\\nher rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\\r\\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\\r\\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis,\\r\\nwe reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and\\r\\nsheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear\\r\\nthe cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then\\r\\nI remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.\\r\\nSo being much troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed,\\r\\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for\\r\\nit was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\\r\\ntherefore, away from the island.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an insolent\\r\\nanswer. ‘Ulysses,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and\\r\\nnever get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men are\\r\\nexhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook\\r\\nthemselves a good supper upon this island, but bid them put out to sea and go\\r\\nfaring fruitlessly on through the watches of the flying night. It is by night\\r\\nthat the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one\\r\\nof those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often wreck\\r\\na vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey\\r\\nthe behests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\\r\\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that heaven meant\\r\\nus a mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you are many against one,\\r\\nbut at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with\\r\\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a\\r\\nsingle head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given\\r\\nus.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made\\r\\nthe ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men\\r\\nwent ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\r\\ndrink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up\\r\\nand eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off\\r\\ninto a sound sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Jove\\r\\nraised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that land and sea were\\r\\ncovered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and\\r\\ndrew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I\\r\\ncalled the men together in council.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\\r\\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these\\r\\ncattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything.’ And again they promised that they would obey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was no\\r\\nother wind, but only South and East.[105] As long as corn and wine held out\\r\\nthe men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had\\r\\neaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with\\r\\nhook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands\\r\\non; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might\\r\\npray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough\\r\\nto be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and\\r\\nby they sent me off into a sweet sleep.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not anxious to\\r\\navoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck\\r\\nthe Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from\\r\\nescorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a\\r\\nhuge mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very moment\\r\\nwhen the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into\\r\\na rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and\\r\\nyou can then bury their city under the mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\\r\\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way,\\r\\nhad got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it\\r\\ndown with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he\\r\\nwent away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards\\r\\nhis neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship\\r\\nin the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the whole of her\\r\\nonly a moment ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous said, “I\\r\\nremember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Neptune would be angry\\r\\nwith us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a\\r\\nPhaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a\\r\\nhigh mountain. This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all\\r\\ncoming true.[117]\\r\\nNow therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off\\r\\ngiving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\\r\\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our\\r\\ncity under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they were afraid and\\r\\ngot ready the bulls.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune, standing\\r\\nround his altar; and at the same time[118] Ulysses woke up once more upon his\\r\\nown soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover,\\r\\nJove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know\\r\\nof his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his\\r\\nwife or his fellow citizens and friends recognising him[119] until he had taken his revenge upon\\r\\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him—the\\r\\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees,\\r\\nappeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land. So he\\r\\nsmote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage\\r\\nand uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put all this treasure,\\r\\nand which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over there with the Phaeacians; or\\r\\nI could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and\\r\\ngiven me an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I\\r\\ncannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good\\r\\ntruth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by\\r\\nme, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to\\r\\nIthaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise\\r\\nthem, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I\\r\\nsuppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but\\r\\nthere was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own\\r\\ncountry, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing\\r\\nhis hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of\\r\\ndelicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her\\r\\nshoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in this\\r\\ncountry; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed towards me.\\r\\nProtect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and\\r\\ncountry is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea\\r\\nboard of some continent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from\\r\\nsomewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is a very\\r\\ncelebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a\\r\\ngood driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of\\r\\nit. It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain\\r\\nand dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and\\r\\nthere are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of\\r\\nIthaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off\\r\\nfrom this Achaean country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country,\\r\\nand he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and made up a lying\\r\\nstory in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it\\r\\nseems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as much more\\r\\nbehind me for my children, but am flying because I killed Orsilochus son of\\r\\nIdomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob\\r\\nme of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on\\r\\nthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served\\r\\nhis father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\\r\\nruler, so I lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the road side, and\\r\\nspeared him as he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark\\r\\nnight and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him,\\r\\nbut as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were\\r\\nPhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the\\r\\nEpeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile,\\r\\nbut the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\\r\\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of us said\\r\\na word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay\\r\\ndown just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took\\r\\nmy goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the\\r\\nsand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress\\r\\nof mind.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she\\r\\ntook the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be indeed a shifty\\r\\nlying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all manner of craft even\\r\\nthough you had a god for your antagonist. Dare devil that you are, full of\\r\\nguile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive\\r\\nfalsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no\\r\\nmore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are\\r\\nthe most accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for\\r\\ndiplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know Jove’s\\r\\ndaughter Minerva—me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in\\r\\nall your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you?\\r\\nAnd now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to\\r\\nhide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the\\r\\ntroubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell\\r\\nno one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\\r\\nand put up with every man’s insolence, without a word.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so\\r\\nconstantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter\\r\\nfor him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know\\r\\nexceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting\\r\\nbefore Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship after having\\r\\nsacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw\\r\\nno more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a\\r\\ndifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from\\r\\nevil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took\\r\\nme into the town.[120] And now, I beseech you in your\\r\\nfather’s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\\r\\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in\\r\\nall you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\\r\\ncountry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied Minerva,\\r\\n“and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible,\\r\\nshrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage\\r\\nwould at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem\\r\\nto care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have\\r\\nexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no\\r\\npeace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\\r\\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back\\r\\nsafely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with\\r\\nmy uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.[121] I will now,\\r\\nhowever, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps\\r\\nbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive\\r\\ntree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;[122] here too is\\r\\nthe overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to\\r\\nthe nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Ulysses\\r\\nrejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous\\r\\nsoil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, “Naiad nymphs,\\r\\ndaughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore\\r\\nI greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in\\r\\nthe old days, if Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my\\r\\nson to manhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva, “let us\\r\\nrather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be\\r\\nquite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places,\\r\\nwhile Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing\\r\\nwhich the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and\\r\\nMinerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the\\r\\nroot of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the\\r\\nwicked suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on\\r\\nthese disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three\\r\\nyears, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does\\r\\nnothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending encouraging messages[123] to every one\\r\\nof them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to\\r\\nmuch the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me\\r\\nsuch timely information. Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my\\r\\nside and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy’s\\r\\nfair diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three\\r\\nhundred men, if you, goddess, will be with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once we set\\r\\nabout it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance\\r\\nwill then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin by\\r\\ndisguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body\\r\\nwith wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a\\r\\ngarment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine\\r\\neyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of\\r\\nyour wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the\\r\\nswineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected\\r\\ntowards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding\\r\\nhis pigs near the rock that is called Raven[124] by the fountain Arethusa, where\\r\\nthey are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with\\r\\nhim and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your\\r\\nson, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out\\r\\nwhether you are still alive.”[125]\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did\\r\\nyou want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others\\r\\nare eating up his estate?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be well\\r\\nspoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite\\r\\ncomfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The\\r\\nsuitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to\\r\\nkill him before he can get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but\\r\\nrather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a\\r\\ngrave themselves.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will get\\r\\nUlysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a\\r\\nlodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth;\\r\\nevery one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her\\r\\nfalsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks them all\\r\\nmanner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have lost\\r\\ntheir husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless\\r\\nmake up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\\r\\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones\\r\\nare lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and\\r\\na bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go where I may I\\r\\nshall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother\\r\\nand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my\\r\\nparents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country;\\r\\nit is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without\\r\\nreverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took\\r\\nsuch care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of belief\\r\\nabout your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but\\r\\nwill swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till he has\\r\\nactually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will.\\r\\nI am in great want, but I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a\\r\\nman, even as I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\\r\\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses\\r\\nto which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will.\\r\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\r\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill\\r\\ntreating his wife and son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither get paid\\r\\nfor bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in\\r\\npeace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all\\r\\nthis; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honoured master. As for\\r\\nyour oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope,\\r\\nhis old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about\\r\\nthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be\\r\\nno worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or\\r\\nman, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get\\r\\nnews of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\r\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca.\\r\\nBut let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape\\r\\nif the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,\\r\\ntell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where\\r\\nyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came\\r\\nin, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to\\r\\ncome—for you cannot have come by land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat and\\r\\nwine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat\\r\\nand drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole\\r\\ntwelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has\\r\\npleased heaven to visit me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many sons born\\r\\nin marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a\\r\\nconcubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage I claim,\\r\\nand who was held in the highest honour among the Cretans for his wealth,\\r\\nprosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me on the same level with my\\r\\nbrothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but\\r\\nto me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me\\r\\nto marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on\\r\\nthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you\\r\\ncan see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\r\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy\\r\\nwith an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to\\r\\nleap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I\\r\\ndid not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\\r\\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things\\r\\nthat most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another\\r\\nanother, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the\\r\\nAchaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign\\r\\nservice, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first\\r\\ninstance, and much more was allotted to me later on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove\\r\\ncounselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people\\r\\nrequired me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there was no way out\\r\\nof it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years,\\r\\nbut in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven\\r\\ndispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one\\r\\nmonth happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the\\r\\nidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.\\r\\nI had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my\\r\\nmen made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\r\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from\\r\\nCrete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a river.\\r\\nNothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but\\r\\nsat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On\\r\\nthe fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\\r\\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out\\r\\nscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\n---------new doc---------\\nBOOK XV\\n\\r\\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS AT PYLOS\\r\\nAND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA—ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son that he\\r\\nwas to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt\\r\\nof Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus could get no\\r\\nrest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to\\r\\nhim and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave\\r\\nyour property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up\\r\\neverything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand. Ask\\r\\nMenelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother\\r\\nstill there when you get back. Her father and brothers are already urging her\\r\\nto marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any of the others, and has\\r\\nbeen greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\\r\\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they\\r\\nalways want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never\\r\\ngive another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their\\r\\nfather either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\\r\\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until\\r\\nit shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of\\r\\nanother matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors\\r\\nare lying in wait for you in the Strait[128] between Ithaca and Samos, and they\\r\\nmean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\\r\\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your\\r\\nproperty will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship\\r\\nwell away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will\\r\\nsend you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to\\r\\nthe town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\\r\\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night,\\r\\nand then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from\\r\\nPylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with his heel\\r\\nto rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the horses to the\\r\\nchariot, for we must set off home.”[129]\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the\\r\\ndark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his presents and\\r\\nput them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to us in the usual\\r\\nway. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him\\r\\nkindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, leaving\\r\\nHelen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put on his shirt as\\r\\nfast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to meet\\r\\nhim. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go back now to my own country, for I want to\\r\\nget home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not detain\\r\\nyou. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to\\r\\nhim. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants\\r\\nto do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should\\r\\ntreat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to\\r\\nleave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot,\\r\\nand till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\\r\\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a\\r\\nlong journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in\\r\\nthe Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all\\r\\nour principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will\\r\\ngive us something—a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I came\\r\\naway I left my property without protection, and fear that while looking for my\\r\\nfather I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been\\r\\nstolen during my absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At this moment\\r\\nEteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaus\\r\\ntold him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then\\r\\nMenelaus went down into his fragrant store room,[130] not alone, but Helen went too, with\\r\\nMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his house were\\r\\nkept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a\\r\\nsilver mixing bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely\\r\\ndresses which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was\\r\\nlargest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a\\r\\nstar, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. [131] Then they all came back through the\\r\\nhouse again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may\\r\\nJove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your\\r\\ndesire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate\\r\\nin all my house. It is a mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is\\r\\ninlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\\r\\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on\\r\\nmy return home. I should like to give it to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, while\\r\\nMegapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before him. Hard by\\r\\nstood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from the hand\\r\\nof Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day. Till then, get\\r\\nyour dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own\\r\\ncountry and to your home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son of\\r\\nNisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors\\r\\nfrom the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation,\\r\\nmoreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other suitors,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good natural disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking\\r\\nto them plainly and in all honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus.\\r\\nIt is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take\\r\\ncounsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to\\r\\nkill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us,\\r\\nI would have you hold your hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and\\r\\nwent to the house of Ulysses, where they took their accustomed seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She knew of\\r\\nthe plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard their counsels\\r\\nand had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens,\\r\\nand when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts\\r\\nsupporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked\\r\\nAntinous saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and\\r\\ncounsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind.\\r\\nMadman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, and take no heed\\r\\nof suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot\\r\\nthus against one another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this\\r\\nhouse in fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\\r\\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us?\\r\\nThey wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\r\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife and\\r\\ntrying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope\\r\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. The man\\r\\nis not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son\\r\\nTelemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time\\r\\nhas Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put\\r\\npieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I\\r\\nhave, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death\\r\\ncomes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her,\\r\\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva shed\\r\\nsleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son,\\r\\nwho had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another\\r\\nto get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an\\r\\nold man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for\\r\\nfear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and\\r\\ntell Penelope.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,” said he.\\r\\n“What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they still\\r\\nwaiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in the\\r\\ntown. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met\\r\\na man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he was the first to\\r\\ntell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had\\r\\njust got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a\\r\\nship coming into harbour with a number of men in her. They had many shields and\\r\\nspears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus could not\\r\\nsee him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate it,\\r\\nand every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they\\r\\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET—ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE TOWN, AND\\r\\nULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS—HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG ARGOS—HE IS\\r\\nINSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE\\r\\nSHALL BE SENT TO HER.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on\\r\\nhis sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go\\r\\ninto the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd, “I will now go to the\\r\\ntown and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till\\r\\nshe has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let\\r\\nhim beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have\\r\\ntrouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this\\r\\nmakes him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do\\r\\nbetter in town than country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am\\r\\ntoo old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.\\r\\nTherefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as\\r\\nsoon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it.\\r\\nMy clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished\\r\\nwith cold, for you say the city is some way off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the\\r\\nsuitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the\\r\\ncloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\\r\\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the\\r\\nother maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.\\r\\nPenelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she\\r\\nflung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful\\r\\neyes, “Light of my eyes,” she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are\\r\\ncome home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of\\r\\nyour having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my\\r\\nconsent. But come, tell me what you saw.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far country.\\r\\nIf he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what\\r\\nhe could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from\\r\\nhim when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for\\r\\nhis master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never\\r\\ndo their work when their master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes\\r\\nhalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors\\r\\nwere, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come\\r\\nand sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the\\r\\ncarver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought\\r\\nit to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought\\r\\nhim his portion, and gave him bread from the bread-basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable old\\r\\nbeggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon\\r\\nthe threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the\\r\\ninner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had\\r\\nskilfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus\\r\\ntook a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in\\r\\nhis two hands, and said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to\\r\\ngo the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you this, and\\r\\nsays you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and fulfil\\r\\nthe desire of his heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on the\\r\\ndirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing,\\r\\nand had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the\\r\\nbard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of\\r\\nbread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they\\r\\nwere, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to\\r\\nsave a single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from\\r\\nleft to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\\r\\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another\\r\\nwho he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\\r\\n“Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have\\r\\nseen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the\\r\\nman himself, nor where he comes from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he cried,\\r\\n“what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars\\r\\nenough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing\\r\\nthat such people gather here to waste your master’s property—and must you needs\\r\\nbring this man as well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil. It was\\r\\nno doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a\\r\\nforeign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer,\\r\\na healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his singing?\\r\\nSuch men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar\\r\\nwho will only worry him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of\\r\\nthe other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as\\r\\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\\r\\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of my\\r\\ninterests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this stranger\\r\\nturned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him\\r\\nyourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any\\r\\nof the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I say, for\\r\\nyou are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other\\r\\npeople.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering talk? If\\r\\nall the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here\\r\\nagain for another three months.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the\\r\\ntable, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors\\r\\nall gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was\\r\\nabout, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had\\r\\ngiven him, but he first went up to Antinous and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to\\r\\nbe a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver,\\r\\nand I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich man once, and had\\r\\na fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am,\\r\\nno matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and\\r\\nall the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\\r\\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\\r\\nrobbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my\\r\\nships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over\\r\\nthem, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the\\r\\nwar-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with\\r\\nsoldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic\\r\\namong my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\\r\\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive\\r\\nto do forced labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met\\r\\nthem, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in\\r\\nCyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us\\r\\nduring our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,[145] or I will give\\r\\nyou Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have\\r\\nbegged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have\\r\\nabundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people’s property\\r\\nwhen there is plenty of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, “You wretch, I\\r\\nwill soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too.\\r\\nHas the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?\\r\\nYou seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus.” With this he\\r\\ncaught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of\\r\\nAmphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his\\r\\nright hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and\\r\\nhis wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\\r\\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, “I\\r\\nwish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble\\r\\nhe gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\\r\\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry\\r\\nyour meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do\\r\\nnot wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the\\r\\nsooner you all go home to bed the better.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; but\\r\\nAmphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do not let us take\\r\\noffence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence\\r\\nto the stranger nor to any of Ulysses’ servants. Let the cupbearer go round\\r\\nwith the drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house\\r\\nthat he has come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of Dulichium,\\r\\nservant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round\\r\\nto each of them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the\\r\\nblessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each\\r\\none as he was minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own\\r\\nabode.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR—ULYSSES INTERVIEWS PENELOPE—EURYCLEA\\r\\nWASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO\\r\\nULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside. Make some\\r\\nexcuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have\\r\\ntaken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it\\r\\nwas when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add\\r\\nto this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\r\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\r\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Euryclea\\r\\nand said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take the armour that\\r\\nmy father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now\\r\\nmy father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood.\\r\\nI want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish, child,” answered Euryclea, “that you would take the management of the\\r\\nhouse into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself.\\r\\nBut who is to go with you and light you to the store-room? The maids would have\\r\\ndone so, but you would not let them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The stranger,” said Telemachus, “shall show me a light; when people eat my\\r\\nbread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then\\r\\nUlysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears\\r\\ninside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a\\r\\nsoft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, “Father, my eyes behold a\\r\\ngreat marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on\\r\\nwhich they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god\\r\\nhere who has come down from heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for this is\\r\\nthe manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here to talk with\\r\\nyour mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts of\\r\\nquestions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to\\r\\nthe room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and they set\\r\\nher a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her\\r\\naccustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool all in one\\r\\npiece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she\\r\\nnow sat, and the maids came from the women’s room to join her. They set about\\r\\nremoving the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away\\r\\nthe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\\r\\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both\\r\\nlight and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,\\r\\n“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and\\r\\nspying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\r\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be so angry\\r\\nwith me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and\\r\\nbecause I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars\\r\\ngenerally? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\\r\\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor\\r\\nwhat he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\\r\\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to\\r\\ntake all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that\\r\\npride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest\\r\\nyou get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home,\\r\\nfor there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as\\r\\nyou think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus,\\r\\nwho will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\\r\\nlonger in his boyhood.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat-basket in which it lay,\\r\\nand threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little aside, and\\r\\navoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion[159] as he did so, and it hit the wall,\\r\\nnot him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, “It is a good thing\\r\\nfor you,” said he, “that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him.\\r\\nIf you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father\\r\\nwould have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this\\r\\nhouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\\r\\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\\r\\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you\\r\\nkilling my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put up with\\r\\nthis, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence. Still,\\r\\nif you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such\\r\\ndisgraceful scenes day after day—guests insulted, and men dragging the women\\r\\nservants about the house in an unseemly way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, “No one\\r\\nshould take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite\\r\\nreasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of\\r\\nthe servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to\\r\\nTelemachus and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’\\r\\nI would say, ‘as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come\\r\\nhome, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering[160] the suitors to\\r\\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but\\r\\nit is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\\r\\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one\\r\\nwho makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to\\r\\nmanage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother\\r\\nwill look after some other man’s house, not yours.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\\r\\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering in\\r\\nsome distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother’s marriage; on\\r\\nthe contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her\\r\\nnumberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she\\r\\nshall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits\\r\\nwandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became\\r\\nsmeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy\\r\\nwith forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, “Unhappy men, what is it that\\r\\nails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your\\r\\ncheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and\\r\\nroof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\\r\\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of\\r\\nheaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus then said,\\r\\n“This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him\\r\\nout into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me. I have\\r\\neyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding\\r\\nmind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief\\r\\noverhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and\\r\\nplotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome,\\r\\nbut the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking Telemachus by\\r\\nlaughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, “Telemachus, you\\r\\nare not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes\\r\\nbegging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is\\r\\nperfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as\\r\\na prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board\\r\\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting\\r\\nevery moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed\\r\\nfor her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one\\r\\nwas saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment; it had\\r\\nbeen both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the\\r\\nsupper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the\\r\\nmeal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them—for they had\\r\\nbrought their doom upon themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\r\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS AND\\r\\nPHILOETIUS\\n---------new doc---------\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table[165]—for those which the Achaeans were\\r\\nso shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver—he laid it on the\\r\\ncentre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward\\r\\nhim, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow\\r\\npierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till\\r\\nit had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to\\r\\nTelemachus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at,\\r\\nand I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the\\r\\nsuitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to\\r\\nprepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport\\r\\nthemselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his\\r\\nsword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\r\\nTHE KILLING OF THE SUITORS—THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES ARE MADE\\r\\nTO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his\\r\\nbow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his\\r\\nfeet and said, “The mighty contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo\\r\\nwill vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a\\r\\ntwo-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. He had\\r\\nno thought of death—who amongst all the revellers would think that one man,\\r\\nhowever brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck\\r\\nAntinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he\\r\\nfell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood\\r\\ngushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on\\r\\nit, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to\\r\\nthe ground.[166]\\r\\nThe suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they\\r\\nsprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere\\r\\ntowards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked\\r\\nUlysses very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you shall pay for shooting people\\r\\nin this way: you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you\\r\\nhave slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you\\r\\nfor having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and\\r\\ndid not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But\\r\\nUlysses glared at them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have wasted my\\r\\nsubstance,[167]\\r\\nhave forced my women servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I\\r\\nwas still living. You have feared neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see\\r\\nwhither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We have done\\r\\nmuch wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was the head and\\r\\nfront of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that\\r\\nhe wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted\\r\\nwas something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted\\r\\nto kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met\\r\\nthe death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\\r\\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten\\r\\nand drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will\\r\\nkeep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have\\r\\ndone this no one can complain of your being enraged against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all that you\\r\\nhave in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my\\r\\nhand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your\\r\\nlives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and\\r\\nshoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight;\\r\\ndraw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us\\r\\nhave at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can\\r\\nthen get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with\\r\\na loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his\\r\\nbreast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped\\r\\nhis sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went\\r\\nover on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of\\r\\ndeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him\\r\\naway from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and struck him from\\r\\nbehind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his\\r\\nchest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his\\r\\nforehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the\\r\\nbody, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans\\r\\nmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off\\r\\nat a run, and immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your\\r\\ntemples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour for the\\r\\nswineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or when I am\\r\\nalone they may get me away from the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the\\r\\narmour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets\\r\\nwith horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed\\r\\nhimself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour,\\r\\nand took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows\\r\\nlasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one\\r\\nanother: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall\\r\\nof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his\\r\\nshoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of\\r\\nhorse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,[168] and he grasped two redoubtable\\r\\nbronze-shod spears.\\n---------new doc---------\\nNow there was a trap door[169] on the wall, while at one end of\\r\\nthe pavement[170]\\r\\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a\\r\\nwell-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for\\r\\nonly one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot\\r\\nsome one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on? Help\\r\\nwould come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the narrow\\r\\npassage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man\\r\\ncould prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will\\r\\nbring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and\\r\\nhis son have put them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room of\\r\\nUlysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears,\\r\\nand brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors. Ulysses’\\r\\nheart began to fail him when he saw the suitors[171] putting on their armour and\\r\\nbrandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to\\r\\nTelemachus, “Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or\\r\\nit may be Melanthius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the\\r\\nstore room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go,\\r\\nEumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing\\r\\nthis, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the son of Dolius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the store room\\r\\nto fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was\\r\\nbeside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel Melanthius,\\r\\njust as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if\\r\\nI can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your\\r\\nown revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter\\r\\nwhat they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands and feet behind\\r\\nhim. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then\\r\\nfasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a\\r\\nhigh bearing-post,[172] that he may linger on in an agony.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store\\r\\nroom, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was busy searching\\r\\nfor arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on\\r\\neither side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet\\r\\nin one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by\\r\\nLaertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\\r\\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the\\r\\nhair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\\r\\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told\\r\\nthem; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high\\r\\npillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O\\r\\nswineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as\\r\\nyou deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of\\r\\nOceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to\\r\\nfeast on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their\\r\\narmour they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by\\r\\nthe side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce and\\r\\nfull of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still\\r\\nboth brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having\\r\\nassumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and\\r\\nsaid, “Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many\\r\\ngood turns he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the other\\r\\nside raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to reproach her.\\r\\n“Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him and\\r\\nfighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when we have killed these\\r\\npeople, father and son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your\\r\\nhead, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out,\\r\\nand bring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons\\r\\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live\\r\\nin the city of Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily.[173] “Ulysses,”\\r\\nsaid she, “your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you\\r\\nfought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You\\r\\nkilled many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s\\r\\ncity was taken. How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that\\r\\nyou are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?\\r\\nCome on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcimus\\r\\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to\\r\\nprove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the\\r\\nrafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\\r\\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the\\r\\nsuitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were\\r\\nby far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of\\r\\nUlysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My friends, he will soon have to\\r\\nleave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.\\r\\nThey are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but\\r\\nsix of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with\\r\\nglory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\\r\\nothers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of no\\r\\neffect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft\\r\\nof another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of\\r\\nthe suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My friends, I should say we too had\\r\\nbetter let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they\\r\\nhave done us by killing us outright.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Ulysses\\r\\nkilled Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockman\\r\\nkilled Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a\\r\\ncorner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing\\r\\nthem from the bodies of the dead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for\\r\\nthe most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the cloister; another\\r\\nwent against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall.\\r\\nStill, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus’s\\r\\nwrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but\\r\\nthe spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive\\r\\ninto the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and\\r\\nEumaeus Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\\r\\ntaunted him saying, “Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so foolish as\\r\\nto talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods\\r\\nare far stronger than men. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for\\r\\nthe foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging about in his own house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a spear in\\r\\nclose fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the\\r\\ndart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the\\r\\nground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and\\r\\nthe hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like\\r\\na herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at\\r\\ntheir longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop\\r\\ndown on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,\\r\\nfor they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport—even so did\\r\\nUlysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They\\r\\nmade a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground\\r\\nseethed with their blood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, “Ulysses I beseech you have\\r\\nmercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house\\r\\neither in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they\\r\\nwould not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their\\r\\nsacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to\\r\\ndeserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, “If you were their sacrificing\\r\\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got\\r\\nhome again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.\\r\\nTherefore you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when he was\\r\\nbeing killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on\\r\\nthe back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was\\r\\nyet speaking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he who had been forced by the suitors to\\r\\nsing to them—now tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap\\r\\ndoor,[174] and\\r\\nheld his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to fly out of the cloister\\r\\nand sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which\\r\\nboth Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or\\r\\nwhether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\\r\\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground\\r\\nbetween the mixing bowl [175] and the silver-studded seat; then\\r\\ngoing up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, “Ulysses, I beseech\\r\\nyou have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you\\r\\nkill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays\\r\\nmyself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my\\r\\nhead off. Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent\\r\\nyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\\r\\nand too strong for me, so they made me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he cried, “the\\r\\nman is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always\\r\\ngood to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has already killed\\r\\nhim, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat\\r\\nbeneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed\\r\\nheifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid hold\\r\\nof his knees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay your hand therefore, and tell your\\r\\nfather, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted\\r\\nhis substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved your life,\\r\\nthat you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good\\r\\ndeeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the\\r\\nouter court, and be out of the way of the slaughter—you and the bard—while I\\r\\nfinish my work here inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by\\r\\nJove’s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they\\r\\nwould be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over, to see\\r\\nif anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them\\r\\nall lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which\\r\\nfishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping\\r\\nfor water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the\\r\\nsuitors lying all huddled up one against the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, “Call nurse Euryclea; I have something to say\\r\\nto her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women’s room. “Make haste,” said\\r\\nhe, “you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house.\\r\\nCome outside; my father wishes to speak to you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women’s room and came\\r\\nout, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast\\r\\nand both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was\\r\\nUlysses besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses\\r\\nand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw\\r\\nthat a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, “Old woman,” said he,\\r\\n“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it\\r\\nis an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and their own evil\\r\\ndeeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the\\r\\nwhole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a\\r\\nbad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me\\r\\nwhich of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are\\r\\ninnocent.”[176]\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you the truth, my son,” answered Euryclea. “There are fifty women\\r\\nin the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of\\r\\nhousehold work. Of these, twelve in all[177] have misbehaved, and have been\\r\\nwanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to\\r\\nTelemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to\\r\\ngive orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife\\r\\nall that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not wake her yet,” answered Ulysses, “but tell the women who have\\r\\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses; in\\r\\nthe meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the swineherd. “Begin,”\\r\\nsaid he, “to remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges\\r\\nand clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly\\r\\ncleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed\\r\\nroom and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords\\r\\ntill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in\\r\\nwhich they used to lie in secret with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they\\r\\ncarried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the\\r\\ngatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so\\r\\nthey had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the\\r\\ntables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others\\r\\nshovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all\\r\\naway and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite\\r\\nclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space\\r\\nbetween the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not\\r\\nget away: and Telemachus said to the other two, “I shall not let these women\\r\\ndie a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to\\r\\nsleep with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying he made a ship’s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\\r\\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building,\\r\\nat a good height, lest any of the women’s feet should touch the ground; and as\\r\\nthrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket\\r\\njust as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even\\r\\nso did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die\\r\\nmost miserably.[178] Their feet moved convulsively for a\\r\\nwhile, but not for very long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner court.\\r\\nThere they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave\\r\\nthem to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the\\r\\nhouse, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea,\\r\\n“Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may\\r\\nburn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here\\r\\nwith her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All that you have said is true,” answered Euryclea, “but let me bring you some\\r\\nclean clothes—a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any\\r\\nlonger. It is not right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First light me a fire,” replied Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly\\r\\npurified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went\\r\\ninside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came\\r\\nfrom their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to\\r\\nembrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It\\r\\nmade him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of\\r\\nthem.[179]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\r\\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND—EARLY IN THE MORNING ULYSSES,\\r\\nTELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband\\r\\nhad come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for\\r\\njoy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.\\r\\n“Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she exclaimed, “and see with your own eyes\\r\\nsomething that you have been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last\\r\\nindeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much\\r\\ntrouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill treating his son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good nurse,” answered Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods sometimes send\\r\\nsome very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become\\r\\nsensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you always used to\\r\\nbe a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough\\r\\nalready—talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had\\r\\ntaken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from\\r\\nthe day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\\r\\nagain into the women’s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to\\r\\nbring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding.\\r\\nAs it is your age shall protect you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear child,” answered Euryclea, “I am not mocking you. It is quite true as\\r\\nI tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all\\r\\nkept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew all the time that he\\r\\nwas come back, but kept his father’s secret that he might have his revenge on\\r\\nall these wicked people.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, and wept\\r\\nfor joy. “But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to me; if he has really\\r\\ncome home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single\\r\\nhanded, seeing what a number of them there always were?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was not there,” answered Euryclea, “and do not know; I only heard them\\r\\ngroaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a\\r\\ncorner of the women’s room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch\\r\\nme because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses\\r\\nthat were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other. You would\\r\\nhave enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all\\r\\npiled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\\r\\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so\\r\\ncome with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the\\r\\ndesire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both\\r\\nwife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the\\r\\nsuitors who behaved so badly to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “do not exult too confidently over all this.\\r\\nYou know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come home—more\\r\\nparticularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but what you\\r\\ntell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for\\r\\ntheir great wickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man\\r\\nin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have\\r\\ncome to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away\\r\\nfrom the Achaean land; he will never return home again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, “My child, what are you talking about? but you were\\r\\nall hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never\\r\\ncoming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very\\r\\nmoment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing him I\\r\\nperceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about\\r\\nit, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth;\\r\\nso come with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you,\\r\\nyou may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “however wise you may be you can hardly fathom\\r\\nthe counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I\\r\\nmay see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered\\r\\nwhether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or\\r\\nwhether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the\\r\\nfire, against the wall at right angles[180] [to that by which she had entered],\\r\\nwhile Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and\\r\\nwaiting to see what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a\\r\\nlong time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\\r\\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\\r\\nclothes and failed to recognise him,[181] till Telemachus began to reproach\\r\\nher and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother—but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why do you\\r\\nkeep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin\\r\\ntalking to him and asking him questions? No other woman could bear to keep away\\r\\nfrom her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\\r\\nand after having gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a\\r\\nstone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope answered, “My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no\\r\\nwords in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look\\r\\nhim straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his own\\r\\nhome again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there\\r\\nare tokens with which we two are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from\\r\\nall others.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me to any\\r\\nproof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me\\r\\nfor the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with\\r\\ndirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better\\r\\ndo next. When one man has killed another—even though he was not one who would\\r\\nleave many friends to take up his quarrel—the man who has killed him must still\\r\\nsay good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\\r\\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\\r\\nconsider this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look to it yourself, father,” answered Telemachus, “for they say you are the\\r\\nwisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can\\r\\ncompare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find\\r\\nus fail you in so far as our strength holds out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will say what I think will be best,” answered Ulysses. “First wash and put\\r\\nyour shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemius\\r\\nshall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,\\r\\nor any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice\\r\\nit, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the\\r\\ndeath of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\\r\\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\\r\\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put\\r\\ntheir shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took his lyre and set\\r\\nthem all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the\\r\\nsound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, “I suppose the\\r\\nqueen has been getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for\\r\\nnot continuing to protect her husband’s property until he comes home.”[182]\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made\\r\\nthe bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse\\r\\nwent back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman\\r\\nEurynome[183] to\\r\\nshow Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to\\r\\ntheir room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own\\r\\nold bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\\r\\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncloisters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one\\r\\nanother. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled\\r\\nwith a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her\\r\\naccount, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what\\r\\nhe had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He\\r\\ntold her everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to\\r\\nsleep till he had ended his whole story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\\r\\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops and how he\\r\\nhad punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he then\\r\\nwent on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way,\\r\\nbut even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane\\r\\ncarried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city\\r\\nTelepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save\\r\\nhimself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and\\r\\nhow he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who\\r\\nbore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous\\r\\nsinging of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible\\r\\nCharybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\\r\\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with\\r\\nhis thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being\\r\\nleft alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso,\\r\\nwho kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\\r\\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering\\r\\nhe had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had\\r\\nbeen a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given\\r\\nhim gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\\r\\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that Ulysses had\\r\\nhad both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of\\r\\nOceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his\\r\\ncomfortable bed and said to Penelope, “Wife, we have both of us had our full\\r\\nshare of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented\\r\\nfrom getting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,\\r\\nthat we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\\r\\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will\\r\\ntake many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\\r\\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to\\r\\nthe wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been\\r\\ngrieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though\\r\\nyou have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have\\r\\nbeen killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore,[184] and stay there with your women. See\\r\\nnobody and ask no questions.”[185]\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and\\r\\nEumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they did, and\\r\\narmed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied\\r\\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless\\r\\nconcealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES—ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE OF\\r\\nLAERTES—THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA CONCLUDES\\r\\nA PEACE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he\\r\\nheld the fair golden wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them\\r\\njust as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they\\r\\nfollowed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow\\r\\nof some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which\\r\\nthey hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of\\r\\nsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\\r\\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and\\r\\nthe land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the\\r\\nsouls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus,\\r\\nAntilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaans\\r\\nafter the son of Peleus himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon\\r\\njoined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of\\r\\nthose who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus; and the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles spoke first.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that Jove had loved you better from\\r\\nfirst to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many and brave\\r\\nmen, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the hand of death,\\r\\nwhich no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had\\r\\nyou fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have\\r\\nbuilt a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good\\r\\nname, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Happy son of Peleus,” answered the ghost of Agamemnon, “for having died at\\r\\nTroy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell\\r\\nround you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\\r\\nall huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the\\r\\nlivelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane\\r\\nto stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\\r\\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments.\\r\\nThe Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,\\r\\nwhen she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the\\r\\nsound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked\\r\\nfor fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old\\r\\nNestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, fly\\r\\nnot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her\\r\\nimmortal nymphs to view the body of her son.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man\\r\\nof the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal\\r\\nraiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in\\r\\nlament—calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for\\r\\npity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned you,\\r\\nmortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and\\r\\nmany a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were\\r\\nburnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\\r\\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with\\r\\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their\\r\\nwork, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and\\r\\nin pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them—gift of\\r\\nBacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones\\r\\nwith those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also\\r\\nthose of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades\\r\\nnow that Patroclus was no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out\\r\\nover the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by\\r\\nthose now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother begged\\r\\nprizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of\\r\\nthe Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when\\r\\nthe young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death\\r\\nof some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\r\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your\\r\\nfame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all\\r\\nmankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were\\r\\ndone? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus\\r\\nand those of my wicked wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts\\r\\nof the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of Agamemnon and\\r\\nAchilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once. The ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had\\r\\nbeen his host, so it began to talk to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Amphimedon,” it said, “what has happened to all you fine young men—all of an\\r\\nage too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could pick no finer\\r\\nbody of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you\\r\\nwhen you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland\\r\\nwhen you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you\\r\\nnot remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to\\r\\njoin us with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume\\r\\nour voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I\\r\\nremember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately\\r\\nabout the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses had been long gone,\\r\\nand we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not\\r\\nmarry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our\\r\\ndestruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great\\r\\ntambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\\r\\nneedlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\\r\\npress me to marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in\\r\\nneedlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\\r\\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\\r\\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is what she said,\\r\\nand we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day\\r\\nlong, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She\\r\\nfooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time\\r\\nwore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many\\r\\ndays had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told\\r\\nus, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\\r\\nwhether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after\\r\\nshe had had it washed,[186] its splendour was as that of the\\r\\nsun or moon.\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round the\\r\\ntown, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as\\r\\nsoon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter,\\r\\ngroaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took the dead away,\\r\\nburied every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere\\r\\non board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own\\r\\nplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got\\r\\ntogether Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\\r\\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\\r\\nweeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He\\r\\ntook many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both\\r\\nships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the\\r\\nforemost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get\\r\\naway to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of\\r\\nourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we\\r\\ndo not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should\\r\\nhave no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then,\\r\\nand after them, before they can cross over to the main land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemius\\r\\nhad now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses. Every one was\\r\\nastonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and\\r\\nMedon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not do these things against\\r\\nthe will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and\\r\\nstand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and\\r\\nnow going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell\\r\\nthick on one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose\\r\\nto speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future; so\\r\\nhe spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they\\r\\nhave; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the\\r\\nfolly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their\\r\\nhearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the wife of a chieftain who they\\r\\nthought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell\\r\\nyou. Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing\\r\\ndown evil on your own heads.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left\\r\\nthe assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of\\r\\nHalitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore\\r\\nhurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met\\r\\ntogether in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He\\r\\nthought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was\\r\\nnever to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me\\r\\nthis question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting still\\r\\nfurther, or will you make peace between them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own\\r\\narrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do\\r\\nwhatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most reasonable\\r\\narrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant,\\r\\nin virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to\\r\\nforgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all\\r\\nbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from\\r\\noff the topmost summits of Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, “Some\\r\\nof you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us.” So one of\\r\\nDolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them\\r\\nall quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here they are, let us put on our armour\\r\\nat once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could—that is to say Ulysses, his\\r\\nthree men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did the\\r\\nsame—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they had all put\\r\\non their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form and voice\\r\\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show\\r\\nevery man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent\\r\\nfor their strength and courage all the world over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall see, if\\r\\nyou will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed, “what a\\r\\nday I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying\\r\\nwith one another in the matter of valour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius—-best friend I\\r\\nhave in the world—pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove her father; then\\r\\npoise your spear and hurl it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed to her\\r\\nhe poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went\\r\\nright through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armour rang rattling\\r\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell\\r\\nupon the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears;\\r\\nindeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever\\r\\ngetting home again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one\\r\\npause. “Men of Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the\\r\\nmatter at once without further bloodshed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms\\r\\ndropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess’\\r\\nvoice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But Ulysses gave a great\\r\\ncry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the\\r\\nson of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so\\r\\nshe said to Ulysses, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife,\\r\\nor Jove will be angry with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly.

The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and Charybdis, and the\\r\\n alternative between them and something untold merges into the alternative\\r\\n whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or Charybdis. Yet from line 260, it\\r\\n seems we are to consider the Wanderers as having been passed by Ulysses; this\\r\\n appears even more plainly from xxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions\\r\\n the Wandering rocks as having been between the Sirens and Scylla and\\r\\n Charybdis. The writer, however, is evidently unaware that she does not quite\\r\\n understand her own story; her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that\\r\\n though Trapanese sailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other\\r\\n localities really were, no one in those days more than in our own could\\r\\n localise the Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann has argued, were derived not\\r\\n from any particular spot, but from sailors’ tales about the difficulties of\\r\\n navigating the group of the Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on “Od.” x.\\r\\n 3). Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she would not\\r\\n forgo them. The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on Scylla suggests\\r\\n allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is on the Italian side,\\r\\n and therefore may be said to look West. It is about 8 miles thence to the\\r\\n Sicilian coast, so Ulysses may be perfectly well told that after passing\\r\\n Scylla he will come to the Thrinacian island or Sicily.

Nay,\\r\\nbut even so he saved not his company, though he desired it sore. For through\\r\\nthe blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen\\r\\nof Helios Hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these\\r\\nthings, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\\r\\ndeclare thou even unto us.\\r\\n    Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home, and\\r\\nhad escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for\\r\\nhis homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her\\r\\nhollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when now the year had come\\r\\nin the courses of the seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should\\r\\nreturn home to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among\\r\\nhis own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually\\r\\nagainst godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had\\r\\nnow departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in\\r\\ntwain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where\\r\\nhe rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he\\r\\nmade merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls\\r\\nof Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak,\\r\\nfor he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of\\r\\nAgamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the\\r\\nImmortals:\\r\\n    ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say\\r\\ncomes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own\\r\\nhearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\\r\\nbeyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of\\r\\nAtreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his\\r\\neyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\\r\\nslayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the\\r\\nson of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come\\r\\nto man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed\\r\\nnot on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one\\r\\nprice for all.’\\r\\n    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our\\r\\nfather Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death\\r\\nthat is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is\\r\\nrent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long\\r\\nwhile suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a\\r\\nwoodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the\\r\\nwizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall\\r\\npillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the\\r\\nhapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him\\r\\nto forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the\\r\\nsmoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine\\r\\nheart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of\\r\\nthe Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land?\\r\\nWherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the\\r\\n“Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with\\r\\nmarginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this end in my MS. I\\r\\nfound, however, that the translation would be thus hopelessly scholasticised,\\r\\nand abandoned my intention. I would nevertheless urge on those who have the\\r\\nmanagement of our University presses, that they would render a great service to\\r\\nstudents if they would publish a Greek text of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic\\r\\npassages printed in a different type, and with marginal references. I have\\r\\ngiven the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages\\r\\nunderlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked with all\\r\\nthe Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of both the “Iliad” and\\r\\n“Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAny one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round\\r\\nthe “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his reader’s mind\\r\\nthat the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood, and\\r\\nhence (even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion) presumably by one\\r\\nperson only—that it was written certainly before 750, and in all probability\\r\\nbefore 1000 B.C.—that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably\\r\\nfamiliar with the “Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those\\r\\nbooks whose genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are\\r\\nadmitted to be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his\\r\\nreaders, is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who\\r\\nwill mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British Museum\\r\\nabove referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common sense can\\r\\ndraw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems, will, I\\r\\nbelieve, find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number\\r\\nof books here and on the Continent that at present enjoy considerable\\r\\nreputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps is an advantage better worth\\r\\nsecuring, he will find that many puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him\\r\\non the discovery that they arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOther difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the poem\\r\\nin the writer’s mind is understood. I have dealt with this at some length in\\r\\npp. 251-261 of “The Authoress of the Odyssey”. Briefly, the “Odyssey” consists\\r\\nof two distinct poems: (1) The Return of Ulysses, which alone the Muse is asked\\r\\nto sing in the opening lines of the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian\\r\\nepisode, and the account of Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books\\r\\nix.-xii. It consists of lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i., of line 28 of Book v.,\\r\\nand thence without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii., at\\r\\nwhich point the original scheme was abandoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of Telemachus’\\r\\nvoyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of Book i., is\\r\\ncontinued to the end of Book iv., and not resumed till Ulysses wakes in the\\r\\nmiddle of line 187, Book xiii., from whence it continues to the end of Book\\r\\nxxiv.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn “The Authoress of the Odyssey”, I wrote:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and they flew on\\r\\nand on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When\\r\\nthey were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,\\r\\nbeating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that\\r\\nwere below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off\\r\\ntowards the right over the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and\\r\\nasked each other what all this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\\r\\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all\\r\\nhonesty, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I\\r\\nsee mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away much longer;\\r\\nindeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them\\r\\nalone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let us then be wise in\\r\\ntime, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so\\r\\nof their own accord; it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying\\r\\nwithout due knowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when\\r\\nthe Argives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through\\r\\nmuch hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\\r\\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, “Go home, old man, and prophesy to your\\r\\nown children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much\\r\\nbetter than you can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or\\r\\nother, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has died in a far country, and it\\r\\nis a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens\\r\\nand adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I\\r\\nsuppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell\\r\\nyou—and it shall surely be—when an old man like you, who should know better,\\r\\ntalks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his\\r\\nyoung friend will only fare so much the worse—he will take nothing by it, for\\r\\nthe suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir,\\r\\nupon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon\\r\\nyou. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his\\r\\nmother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all\\r\\nthe marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on\\r\\nharassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with\\r\\nall his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as\\r\\nmuch as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back and\\r\\ncontinue to eat up Telemachus’s estate without paying him, till such time as\\r\\nhis mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe\\r\\nof expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare\\r\\nperfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\\r\\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more,\\r\\nand entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my\\r\\nstory. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and\\r\\nthither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so\\r\\nlong been missing. Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear\\r\\nthings in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of\\r\\nhim as alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\\r\\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I\\r\\nwill return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a\\r\\nbarrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor[20] who had been a friend of Ulysses, and\\r\\nhad been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants,\\r\\nrose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\\r\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; I hope\\r\\nthat all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one\\r\\nof you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father.\\r\\nI am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in\\r\\nthe naughtiness of their hearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not\\r\\nreturn, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you\\r\\nothers I am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying\\r\\nto stop such scandalous goings on—which you could do if you chose, for you are\\r\\nmany and they are few.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, “Mentor, what folly is all\\r\\nthis, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man\\r\\nto fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses himself were to set\\r\\nupon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his\\r\\nwife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing,\\r\\nand his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds.\\r\\nThere is no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people\\r\\ngo about your business, and let his father’s old friends, Mentor and\\r\\nHalitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I do not\\r\\nthink he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\\r\\nand tells him something.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode,\\r\\nwhile the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the grey\\r\\nwaves, and prayed to Minerva.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” he cried, “you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the\\r\\nseas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey you, but\\r\\nthe Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I\\r\\ncannot do so.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the\\r\\nvoice of Mentor. “Telemachus,” said she, “if you are made of the same stuff as\\r\\nyour father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never\\r\\nbroke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take after him, your\\r\\nvoyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of\\r\\nPenelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom\\r\\nas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\\r\\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not\\r\\nentirely without some share of your father’s wise discernment, I look with hope\\r\\nupon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause with any of those\\r\\nfoolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to\\r\\ndeath and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that\\r\\nthey shall perish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long\\r\\ndelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a\\r\\nship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\\r\\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see\\r\\neverything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the\\r\\nstaff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up\\r\\nvolunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I will run\\r\\nmy eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and\\r\\nwill put out to sea without delay.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as\\r\\nthe goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the suitors flaying goats\\r\\nand singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came up to him at once and\\r\\nlaughed as he took his hand in his own, saying, “Telemachus, my fine\\r\\nfire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink\\r\\nwith us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and\\r\\na picked crew to boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news\\r\\nof your noble father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of\\r\\nany kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so\\r\\nmuch good property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know\\r\\nmore about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by\\r\\ngoing to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will\\r\\nnot be in vain—though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of\\r\\nmy own, and must be passenger not captain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the others\\r\\nwent on getting dinner ready about the buildings,[21] jeering at him tauntingly as they did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said one youngster, “means to be the death of us; I suppose he\\r\\nthinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where\\r\\nhe seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in\\r\\nour wine and kill us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be like his\\r\\nfather and perish far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to\\r\\ndo, for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we\\r\\ncan let his mother and the man who marries her have that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious\\r\\nstore-room where his father’s treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon\\r\\nthe floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests.\\r\\nHere, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old,\\r\\nwell-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against\\r\\nthe wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all. The room was closed\\r\\nwith well-made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old\\r\\nhouse-keeper Euryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of\\r\\neverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are keeping\\r\\nfor my father’s own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and\\r\\nfind his way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they\\r\\nall have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley meal—about\\r\\ntwenty measures in all. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing\\r\\nabout it. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has\\r\\ngone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can\\r\\nhear anything about the return of my dear father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, “My\\r\\ndear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in\\r\\nthe world do you want to go to—you, who are the one hope of the house? Your\\r\\npoor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as\\r\\nsoon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you\\r\\nput out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay\\r\\nwhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your\\r\\nlife out on the barren ocean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fear not, nurse,” answered Telemachus, “my scheme is not without heaven’s\\r\\nsanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till\\r\\nI have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone,\\r\\nand asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had\\r\\ncompleted her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the\\r\\nbarley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back to the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and went\\r\\nround the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by\\r\\nsundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and asked him to let her have\\r\\na ship—which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was\\r\\nover all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board\\r\\nher that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour.\\r\\nPresently the crew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors into a deep\\r\\nslumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups\\r\\nfrom their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back\\r\\ninto the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she\\r\\ntook the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus,” said she, “the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for\\r\\nyou to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all\\r\\nmarvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus by the\\r\\nhand. “My friend,” said he, “I see that you are going to be a great hero some\\r\\nday, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young. This can\\r\\nhave been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Jove’s redoubtable\\r\\ndaughter, the Trito-born, who shewed such favour towards your brave father\\r\\namong the Argives. Holy queen,” he continued, “vouchsafe to send down thy grace\\r\\nupon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in\\r\\nsacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\\r\\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up to you in\\r\\nsacrifice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own\\r\\nhouse, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got there and had\\r\\ntaken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine\\r\\nthat was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that\\r\\nheld it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to\\r\\nMinerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink\\r\\nofferings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to\\r\\nbed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that\\r\\nwas over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now\\r\\nleft him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the\\r\\nqueen his wife by his side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left his\\r\\ncouch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood\\r\\nin front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but\\r\\nhe was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat\\r\\nsceptre in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their\\r\\nrooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and\\r\\nThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them\\r\\nthey made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My sons,” said he, “make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and\\r\\nforemost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested herself\\r\\nvisibly to me during yesterday’s festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to\\r\\nthe plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it\\r\\nat once. Another must go to Telemachus’ ship, and invite all the crew, leaving\\r\\ntwo men only in charge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus\\r\\nthe goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where\\r\\nyou are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to\\r\\nfetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me\\r\\nsome clear spring water.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was brought in\\r\\nfrom the plain, and Telemachus’s crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought\\r\\nthe anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva\\r\\nherself came to accept the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith\\r\\ngilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their\\r\\nbeauty. Then Stratius and Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched\\r\\nwater from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his\\r\\nother hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a\\r\\nsharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor\\r\\nbegan with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered\\r\\nmany a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer’s head upon the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal[32] Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and\\r\\nbrought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base\\r\\nof her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters in law of Nestor, and his\\r\\nvenerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with\\r\\ndelight. Then they lifted the heifer’s head from off the ground, and\\r\\nPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they\\r\\ncut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round\\r\\nin two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then\\r\\nNestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young\\r\\nmen stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were\\r\\nburned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up\\r\\nsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor’s youngest daughter, washed Telemachus. When\\r\\nshe had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and\\r\\nshirt,[33] and he\\r\\nlooked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of\\r\\nNestor. When the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat\\r\\ndown to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept\\r\\npouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to\\r\\neat and drink Nestor said, “Sons, put Telemachus’s horses to the chariot that\\r\\nhe may start at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses\\r\\nto the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and\\r\\nsweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus got into the chariot,\\r\\nwhile Pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed\\r\\nthe horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country, leaving\\r\\nthe high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying\\r\\nthe yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\\r\\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\\r\\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they\\r\\nagain yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\\r\\ngatehouse.[34]\\r\\nPisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently\\r\\nthey came to the corn lands of the open country, and in the course of time\\r\\ncompleted their journey, so well did their steeds take them.[35]\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK IV\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS, WHO TELLS HIS STORY—MEANWHILE THE SUITORS IN ITHACA\\r\\nPLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Do we know, Menelaus,” said she, “the names of these strangers who have come\\r\\nto visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help saying what I\\r\\nthink. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed\\r\\nwhen I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is like\\r\\nTelemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to\\r\\nTroy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear wife,” replied Menelaus, “I see the likeness just as you do. His hands\\r\\nand feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair, with the shape of his head and\\r\\nthe expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses, and\\r\\nsaying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he\\r\\nhid his face in his mantle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Pisistratus said, “Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that\\r\\nthis young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come\\r\\nhere and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely\\r\\ninteresting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for\\r\\nhe wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son\\r\\nhas always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without\\r\\nsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\\r\\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bless my heart,” replied Menelaus, “then I am receiving a visit from the son\\r\\nof a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake. I had always\\r\\nhoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us\\r\\na safe return from beyond the seas. I should have founded a city for him in\\r\\nArgos, and built him a house. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his\\r\\ngoods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of\\r\\nthe neighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seen one\\r\\nanother continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and\\r\\nhappy an intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\\r\\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept, Telemachus\\r\\nwept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his eyes from filling,\\r\\nwhen he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom the son of bright Dawn had\\r\\nkilled. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you\\r\\nwere a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do\\r\\nas I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper.\\r\\nMorning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry\\r\\nfor those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the poor things. We\\r\\ncan only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a\\r\\nbrother who died at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\\r\\nto have known him—his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself,\\r\\nbut they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your discretion, my friend,” answered Menelaus, “is beyond your years. It is\\r\\nplain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one\\r\\nwhom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring—and it has blessed\\r\\nNestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own\\r\\nhouse, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put\\r\\nan end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water\\r\\nbe poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\\r\\nthe morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they\\r\\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the\\r\\nwine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever\\r\\ndrinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not\\r\\neven though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a\\r\\nbrother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of such\\r\\nsovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon,\\r\\na woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into\\r\\nthe mixing bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country\\r\\nis a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put\\r\\nthis drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable men\\r\\n(which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do\\r\\nwhat he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in\\r\\nseason. I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I\\r\\ncan say what he did when he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts\\r\\nof difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself\\r\\nall in rags, and entered the enemy’s city looking like a menial or a beggar,\\r\\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people. In this\\r\\ndisguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him. I alone\\r\\nrecognised him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When,\\r\\nhowever, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I\\r\\nhad sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely\\r\\nback to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant\\r\\nto do. He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\\r\\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my\\r\\nown part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home, and I\\r\\nwas unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,\\r\\naway from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by\\r\\nno means deficient either in person or understanding.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Menelaus said, “All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I\\r\\nhave travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I have never seen\\r\\nsuch another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and what courage he displayed\\r\\nwithin the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in\\r\\nwait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.[43] At that moment you came up to us;\\r\\nsome god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you had\\r\\nDeiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat\\r\\nit; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our\\r\\nwives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made.\\r\\nDiomed and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there,\\r\\nor to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite\\r\\nstill, all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses\\r\\nclapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\\r\\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“How sad,” exclaimed Telemachus, “that all this was of no avail to save him,\\r\\nnor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed,\\r\\nthat we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was in the\\r\\ngatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top\\r\\nof them with woollen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out,\\r\\ncarrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently conducted\\r\\nthe strangers. Thus, then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the\\r\\nforecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by\\r\\nhis side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then,\\r\\ntaking a seat near Telemachus he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?\\r\\nAre you on public, or private business? Tell me all about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come, sir,” replied Telemachus, “to see if you can tell me anything\\r\\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is\\r\\nbeing wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers\\r\\nof my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother.\\r\\nTherefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my\\r\\nfather’s melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it\\r\\nfrom some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften\\r\\nthings out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\\r\\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\\r\\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as\\r\\nin my favour and tell me truly all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. “So,” he exclaimed, “these\\r\\ncowards would usurp a brave man’s bed? A hind might as well lay her new born\\r\\nyoung in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some\\r\\ngrassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with\\r\\nthe pair of them—and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove,\\r\\nMinerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled\\r\\nwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans\\r\\ncheered him—if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would\\r\\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I\\r\\nwill not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all\\r\\nthat the old man of the sea told me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my\\r\\nhecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict\\r\\nabout having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a\\r\\nday with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos—it\\r\\nhas a good harbour from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have\\r\\ntaken in water—and here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a\\r\\nbreath of fair wind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of\\r\\nprovisions and my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon\\r\\nme and saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of\\r\\nthe sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used\\r\\nto go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of catching a\\r\\nfish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger. ‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘it\\r\\nseems to me that you like starving in this way—at any rate it does not greatly\\r\\ntrouble you, for you stick here day after day, without even trying to get away\\r\\nthough your men are dying by inches.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Let me tell you,’ said I, ‘whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be,\\r\\nthat I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods\\r\\nthat live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything, which of\\r\\nthe immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I\\r\\nmay sail the sea so as to reach my home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ replied she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an\\r\\nold immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is Proteus. He\\r\\nis an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is Neptune’s head man and\\r\\nknows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him\\r\\nand hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to\\r\\ntake, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also\\r\\ntell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both good\\r\\nand bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Can you show me,’ said I, ‘some stratagem by means of which I may catch this\\r\\nold god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a god is not easily\\r\\ncaught—not by a mortal man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time\\r\\nwhen the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea comes up\\r\\nfrom under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water over his\\r\\nhead. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to sleep in a great sea\\r\\ncave, where the seals—Halosydne’s chickens as they call them—come up also from\\r\\nthe grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and\\r\\nfish-like smell do they bring with them. [44] Early to-morrow morning I will take\\r\\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three\\r\\nbest men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the\\r\\nold man will play you.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen\\r\\nthem and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them, as a\\r\\nshepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep seize him; put\\r\\nforth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to\\r\\nget away from you. He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes\\r\\nupon the earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him\\r\\nfast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and comes\\r\\nback to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your\\r\\nhold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry\\r\\nwith you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place\\r\\nwhere my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care\\r\\nas I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was\\r\\nfalling, and camped down upon the beach.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into\\r\\nthin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid\\r\\nhad been her dream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent\\r\\non murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great\\r\\nsize, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either\\r\\nside of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in\\r\\nambush.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK V\\n\\r\\nCALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light alike\\r\\nto mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them, Jove the lord\\r\\nof thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to tell them of the many\\r\\nsufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph\\r\\nCalypso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” said she, “and all you other gods that live in everlasting\\r\\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler\\r\\nany more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth\\r\\ncruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten\\r\\nUlysses, who ruled them as though he were their father. There he is, lying in\\r\\ngreat pain in an island where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him\\r\\ngo; and he cannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither ships\\r\\nnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying\\r\\nto murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and\\r\\nLacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What, my dear, are you talking about?” replied her father, “did you not send\\r\\nhim there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to get home and\\r\\npunish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to protect Telemachus, and\\r\\nto see him safely home again, while the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying\\r\\nback without having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, “Mercury, you are our\\r\\nmessenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is\\r\\nto return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men, but after a\\r\\nperilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach fertile Scheria,[50] the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he\\r\\nwere one of ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and\\r\\nwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back\\r\\nfrom Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\\r\\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as he was\\r\\ntold. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could\\r\\nfly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals men’s\\r\\neyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand\\r\\nover Pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the\\r\\nlevel of the sea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing\\r\\nevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the\\r\\nspray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\\r\\nisland which was his journey’s end, he left the sea and went on by land till he\\r\\ncame to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and one\\r\\ncould smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for\\r\\nherself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp\\r\\nand singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder,\\r\\npoplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds had\\r\\nbuilt their nests—owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their\\r\\nbusiness in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew\\r\\nluxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\\r\\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and thither so\\r\\nas to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed.\\r\\n[51] Even a god\\r\\ncould not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still\\r\\nand looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the\\r\\ncave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, no matter how far\\r\\nthey live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was on the sea-shore\\r\\nas usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning\\r\\nand breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: “Why\\r\\nhave you come to see me, Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you do not\\r\\nvisit me often? Say what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and\\r\\nif it can be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him\\r\\nsome red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough, and then\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I have come\\r\\nhere, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove sent me; it was\\r\\nno doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea\\r\\nwhere there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice\\r\\nhecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross\\r\\nJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most\\r\\nill-starred of all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam\\r\\nand sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way home\\r\\nthey sinned against Minerva,[52] who raised both wind and waves\\r\\nagainst them, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\\r\\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at\\r\\nonce, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people,\\r\\nbut shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him\\r\\nfrom the island after washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave\\r\\nhim a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also\\r\\ngave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good meat.\\r\\nMoreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses\\r\\nspread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means\\r\\nof the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on\\r\\nlate-setting Bootes, and on the Bear—which men also call the wain, and which\\r\\nturns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into\\r\\nthe stream of Oceanus—for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days\\r\\nseven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\\r\\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared, rising\\r\\nlike a shield on the horizon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\\r\\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him\\r\\nsailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and\\r\\nmuttered to himself, saying, “Good heavens, so the gods have been changing\\r\\ntheir minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia, and now he is close to\\r\\nthe land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he shall escape from the\\r\\ncalamities that have befallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet\\r\\nbefore he has done with it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred it round\\r\\nin the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and\\r\\nsky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from\\r\\nEast, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same time, and a\\r\\ntremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses’ heart began to fail him. “Alas,” he\\r\\nsaid to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me? I am afraid\\r\\nCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea before I got back\\r\\nhome. It is all coming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds,\\r\\nand what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe\\r\\nto perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in\\r\\nthe cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when\\r\\nthe Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\\r\\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured my name;\\r\\nbut now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled\\r\\nagain, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the\\r\\nforce of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and\\r\\nboth sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Ulysses was under\\r\\nwater, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes\\r\\nCalypso had given him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\\r\\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In\\r\\nspite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast\\r\\nas he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to\\r\\nescape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\\r\\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the South,\\r\\nNorth, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea, saw\\r\\nhim. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank\\r\\nof a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses now was, she had\\r\\ncompassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat\\r\\nupon the raft.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor good man,” said she, “why is Neptune so furiously angry with you? He\\r\\nis giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill\\r\\nyou. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave your\\r\\nraft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast where better\\r\\nluck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round your chest; it is\\r\\nenchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you\\r\\ntouch land take it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\\r\\ngo away again.” With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then\\r\\nshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. “Alas,” he said to himself in his\\r\\ndismay, “this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by\\r\\nadvising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the\\r\\nland where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good\\r\\nway off. I know what I will do—I am sure it will be best—no matter what happens\\r\\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea\\r\\nbreaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that seemed\\r\\nto rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft, which then\\r\\nwent to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a\\r\\nwhirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on\\r\\nhorseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino’s veil\\r\\nunder his arms, and plunged into the sea—meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune\\r\\nwatched him as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\\r\\n“There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do\\r\\npeople. I do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\\r\\nlightly.” On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his palace is.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the winds\\r\\nexcept one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze\\r\\nfrom the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses reached the land of the\\r\\nPhaeacians where he would be safe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with a heavy\\r\\nswell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day\\r\\nbroke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of\\r\\nair stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see\\r\\nland quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father begins to get\\r\\nbetter after having for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some\\r\\nangry spirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when\\r\\nhe again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\\r\\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he\\r\\nbegan to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still\\r\\nbroke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\\r\\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but\\r\\nonly headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\\n---------new doc---------\\nUlysses’ heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to himself,\\r\\n“Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I had given up all\\r\\nhope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,\\r\\nthe rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water close under\\r\\nthem so that I cannot climb out for want of foot hold. I am afraid some great\\r\\nwave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the\\r\\nwater—which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim\\r\\nfurther in search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me\\r\\nout to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster\\r\\nof the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\\r\\nNeptune is very angry with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force\\r\\nagainst the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Minerva\\r\\nhad not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and\\r\\nclung to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that\\r\\ntime; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with it far\\r\\ninto the sea—tearing his hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some\\r\\none plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up along with it—even so did\\r\\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep\\r\\ndown under the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\\r\\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam\\r\\nseaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and\\r\\nat the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some\\r\\nhaven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on,\\r\\nhe came to the mouth of a river, and here he thought would be the best place,\\r\\nfor there were no rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that\\r\\nthere was a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god\\r\\nNeptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost his way has at\\r\\nall times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw near to\\r\\nyour stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O\\r\\nking, for I declare myself your suppliant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm before\\r\\nhim, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Ulysses’\\r\\nknees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him. His\\r\\nbody was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with\\r\\nsea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from\\r\\nsheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came to himself\\r\\nagain, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the\\r\\nsalt[54] stream of\\r\\nthe river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it\\r\\ntowards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and\\r\\nkissed the bounteous earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he cried to himself in his dismay, “what ever will become of me, and\\r\\nhow is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the long\\r\\nwatches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make\\r\\nan end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the\\r\\nriver. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods,\\r\\nand sleep in some thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night’s rest,\\r\\nbut some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one upon some\\r\\nhigh ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive\\r\\nthat grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted sucker, while the other had\\r\\nbeen grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they\\r\\nafforded, nor could the sun’s rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them,\\r\\nso closely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began\\r\\nto make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves\\r\\nlying about—enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter\\r\\nweather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the\\r\\nleaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any\\r\\nneighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having\\r\\nto get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and\\r\\nMinerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\\r\\nall memories of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VI\\n\\r\\nTHE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the\\r\\ncountry and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in the fair town\\r\\nof Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger than\\r\\nthey and plundered them, so their king Nausithous moved them thence and settled\\r\\nthem in Scheria, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall,\\r\\nbuilt houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was\\r\\ndead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were\\r\\ninspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Minerva hie in\\r\\nfurtherance of the return of Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a\\r\\ngirl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alcinous. Two\\r\\nmaid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side of\\r\\nthe doorway, which was closed with well made folding doors. Minerva took the\\r\\nform of the famous sea captain Dymas’s daughter, who was a bosom friend of\\r\\nNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl’s bedside like a\\r\\nbreath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy daughter?\\r\\nHere are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married\\r\\nalmost immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should\\r\\nfind good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get yourself a\\r\\ngood name, and to make your father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that\\r\\nwe make tomorrow a washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you\\r\\nso that you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best\\r\\nyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going to\\r\\nremain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a waggon and\\r\\nmules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and girdles, and you\\r\\ncan ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the\\r\\nwashing-cisterns are some way from the town.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say is the\\r\\neverlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor\\r\\nsnow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great\\r\\npeacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and\\r\\never. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given\\r\\ninstructions to the girl.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I have met,\\r\\nand I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let\\r\\nme have anything that you may have brought hither to wrap your clothes in. May\\r\\nheaven grant you in all things your heart’s desire—husband, house, and a happy,\\r\\npeaceful home; for there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife\\r\\nshould be of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts\\r\\nof their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Nausicaa answered, “Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\\r\\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives prosperity to\\r\\nrich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send\\r\\nyou, and make the best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our\\r\\ncountry, you shall not want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner\\r\\nin distress may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and\\r\\nwill tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am\\r\\ndaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she called her maids and said, “Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not\\r\\nsee a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a\\r\\nmurderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any\\r\\nharm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land’s end that juts\\r\\ninto the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any other people. This is\\r\\nonly some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for\\r\\nstrangers and foreigners in distress are under Jove’s protection, and will take\\r\\nwhat they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\\r\\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back.\\r\\nThey made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and\\r\\nbrought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of\\r\\noil, and told him to go and wash in the stream. But Ulysses said, “Young women,\\r\\nplease to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine from my\\r\\nshoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has\\r\\nhad a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing\\r\\nthere. I am ashamed to strip[56] before a number of good looking young\\r\\nwomen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses washed\\r\\nhimself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad\\r\\nshoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of\\r\\nhis hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which the girl\\r\\nhad given him; Minerva then made him look taller and stronger than before, she\\r\\nalso made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls\\r\\nlike hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a\\r\\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\\r\\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty.\\r\\nThen he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young\\r\\nand handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her\\r\\nmaids:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who live in\\r\\nheaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him\\r\\nplain, but now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I\\r\\nshould like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he would\\r\\nonly stay here and not want to go away. However, give him something to eat and\\r\\ndrink.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and drank\\r\\nravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile,\\r\\nNausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed\\r\\nin the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she called\\r\\nUlysses:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” said she, “rise and let us be going back to the town; I will\\r\\nintroduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can tell you that\\r\\nyou will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I\\r\\nbid you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going past the\\r\\nfields and farm lands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids\\r\\nand I will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the town,\\r\\nwhere you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on\\r\\neither side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\\r\\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You\\r\\nwill see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and\\r\\npaved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship’s gear of\\r\\nall kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars\\r\\nare made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know nothing\\r\\nabout bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their\\r\\nmasts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far over the sea.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later\\r\\non; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met\\r\\nus, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with\\r\\nNausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps\\r\\nhe is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we\\r\\nhave no neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to\\r\\nher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It\\r\\nwould be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband\\r\\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young\\r\\nPhaeacians who are in love with her.’ This is the kind of disparaging remark\\r\\nthat would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be\\r\\nscandalised at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with men in\\r\\nspite of everybody, while her father and mother were still alive, and without\\r\\nhaving been married in the face of all the world.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, “I gather, then, that you are\\r\\nunskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in. I suppose\\r\\nyou are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or\\r\\nmerchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward\\r\\ncargoes. There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame, Sir,” answered Ulysses, fiercely, “you are an insolent fellow—so\\r\\ntrue is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and\\r\\nunderstanding. One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this\\r\\nwith such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his\\r\\nhoneyed moderation carries his hearers with him so that he is leader in all\\r\\nassemblies of his fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may\\r\\nbe as handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.\\r\\nThis is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but\\r\\nyou are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you\\r\\nare quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed, so\\r\\nlong as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.\\r\\nNow, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much\\r\\nboth on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite\\r\\nof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger,\\r\\nmore massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when\\r\\ndisc-throwing among themselves.[68] Then, swinging it back, he threw it\\r\\nfrom his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The\\r\\nPhaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from\\r\\nhis hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form\\r\\nof a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. “A blind man, Sir,”\\r\\nsaid she, “could easily tell your mark by groping for it—it is so far ahead of\\r\\nany other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can\\r\\ncome near to such a throw as yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he\\r\\nbegan to speak more pleasantly. “Young men,” said he, “come up to that throw if\\r\\nyou can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone\\r\\nwants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry; I\\r\\nwill box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all\\r\\nexcept Laodamas, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot\\r\\ncompete with one’s own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or\\r\\na sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host’s family at any game,\\r\\nespecially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\\r\\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else, for I\\r\\nwant to have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at\\r\\nevery kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In\\r\\nbattle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how\\r\\nmany more are taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man\\r\\nwho could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\\r\\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those who still eat\\r\\nbread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like to shoot against the\\r\\nmighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men who could shoot\\r\\nagainst the gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by\\r\\nhis end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him\\r\\nas an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.\\r\\nRunning is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the\\r\\nPhaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my\\r\\nprovisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, “Sir, we have had\\r\\nmuch pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand\\r\\nthat you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some\\r\\ninsolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which\\r\\ncould never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety.\\r\\nI hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief\\r\\nmen who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\\r\\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not\\r\\nparticularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are\\r\\nsingularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of\\r\\ngood dinners, music, and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen, warm\\r\\nbaths, and good beds, so now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set\\r\\nabout dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his\\r\\nfriends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, and\\r\\nminstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of\\r\\nyou and fetch it for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king’s house, and the\\r\\nnine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business\\r\\nto manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth\\r\\nand marked a wide space for the dancers. Presently the servant came back with\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best\\r\\nyoung dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was\\r\\ndelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how they\\r\\nfirst began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus many\\r\\npresents, and defiled King Vulcan’s marriage bed, so the sun, who saw what they\\r\\nwere about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful\\r\\nnews, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its\\r\\nplace, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break,\\r\\nso that they might stay there in that place.[69] When he had finished his snare he\\r\\nwent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\\r\\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not\\r\\neven a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had\\r\\nspread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for\\r\\nthe fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one he was\\r\\nmost fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start,\\r\\nhurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about\\r\\nsitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in\\r\\nhis own, “Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home, but is gone off\\r\\nto Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest, whereon\\r\\nthey were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for them, and\\r\\ncould neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were\\r\\nin a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching\\r\\nLemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious\\r\\npassion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to\\r\\nall the gods.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” he cried, “and all you other blessed gods who live for ever,\\r\\ncome here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you.\\r\\nJove’s daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because I am lame. She is in\\r\\nlove with Mars, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a cripple—but my\\r\\nparents are to blame for that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me.\\r\\nCome and see the pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at\\r\\nthem. They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there\\r\\nlonger than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\\r\\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for\\r\\nhis baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune\\r\\ncame, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses staid\\r\\nat home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in the\\r\\ndoorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they\\r\\nsaw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping\\r\\nVulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god in heaven; and\\r\\nnow Mars will be cast in heavy damages.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, “Messenger Mercury,\\r\\ngiver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you,\\r\\nif you could sleep with Venus?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Apollo,” answered Mercury, “I only wish I might get the chance, though\\r\\nthere were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all of you, gods\\r\\nand goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all\\r\\nseriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again. “Let him go,”\\r\\nhe cried, “and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the\\r\\ndamages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not,” replied Vulcan, “ask me to do this; a bad man’s bond is bad security;\\r\\nwhat remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away and leave his\\r\\ndebts behind him along with his chains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Vulcan,” said Neptune, “if Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will\\r\\npay you myself.” So Vulcan answered, “In this case I cannot and must not refuse\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they\\r\\nscampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to Cyprus and to\\r\\nPaphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here\\r\\nthe Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the\\r\\nimmortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most\\r\\nenchanting beauty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed\\r\\nas they heard him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to\\r\\ncompete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and\\r\\none of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while\\r\\nthe other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came\\r\\ndown again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they\\r\\nbegan to dance, and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards\\r\\nto one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great\\r\\nstamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world,\\r\\nand indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement; let us\\r\\ngive him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are\\r\\ntwelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,\\r\\neach of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him\\r\\nall this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so\\r\\nwith a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\\r\\npresent too, for he has been rude.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their\\r\\nservants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King Alcinous, I will give\\r\\nthe stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have my sword, which is\\r\\nof bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the\\r\\nscabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal\\r\\nto him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, “Good luck to\\r\\nyou, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it\\r\\naway with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you\\r\\nhave been long away from home, and have gone through much hardship.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo which Ulysses answered, “Good luck to you too my friend, and may the gods\\r\\ngrant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me\\r\\nalong with your apology.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards sundown\\r\\nthe presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept\\r\\nbringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his sons received them, and\\r\\nplaced them under their mother’s charge. Then Alcinous led the way to the house\\r\\nand bade his guests take their seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wife,” said he, turning to Queen Arete, “Go, fetch the best chest we have, and\\r\\nput a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some\\r\\nwater; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the\\r\\npresents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy\\r\\nboth his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this\\r\\ngolden goblet—which is of exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me\\r\\nfor the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any\\r\\nof the gods.”[70]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they\\r\\ncould, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they\\r\\nthrew on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\\r\\nabout the belly of the tripod.[71] Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent\\r\\nchest from her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of\\r\\ngold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and\\r\\na good shirt from Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:\\n---------new doc---------\\n“As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground. His\\r\\ngreat neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him.\\r\\nPresently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh\\r\\non which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of\\r\\nwood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any of them\\r\\nshould turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to\\r\\nblaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round\\r\\nme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of\\r\\nthe beam into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept\\r\\nturning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s plank\\r\\nwith an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\\r\\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the\\r\\nboiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the\\r\\nsteam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots\\r\\nof the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\\r\\ninto cold water to temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and\\r\\nit makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round\\r\\nthe beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran\\r\\naway in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his\\r\\neye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so\\r\\nto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they\\r\\ngathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\\r\\nwhat was the matter with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking\\r\\nthe stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep? Surely\\r\\nno man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is trying to kill you either\\r\\nby fraud or by force?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, ‘Noman is killing me by\\r\\nfraud; no man is killing me by force.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then,’ said they, ‘if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Jove\\r\\nmakes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your\\r\\nfather Neptune.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\\r\\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with\\r\\nhis hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the\\r\\ndoorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with\\r\\nthe sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life\\r\\nand those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows that his\\r\\nlife depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nthis plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown, and carried a\\r\\nheavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some\\r\\nof the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man\\r\\nunder the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\\r\\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than\\r\\nany of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the\\r\\nthick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards,\\r\\nkeeping a firm hold on it all the time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but when the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to\\r\\nfeed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked, for\\r\\ntheir udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain\\r\\nfelt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp\\r\\nenough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was\\r\\ngoing out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\\r\\nself, Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\\r\\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with\\r\\na run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to come\\r\\nhome again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because you know your\\r\\nmaster has lost his eye, and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid\\r\\ncrew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life\\r\\nyet. If you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is\\r\\nhiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the\\r\\ncave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has\\r\\ndone me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way out from\\r\\nthe cave and yards, I first got from under the ram’s belly, and then freed my\\r\\ncomrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly heading them in\\r\\nthe right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship. The crew\\r\\nrejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death, but wept for the\\r\\nothers whom the Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding\\r\\nand frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\\r\\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their\\r\\nplaces, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out\\r\\nas my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Cyclops,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your man before\\r\\neating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your visitors in your\\r\\nown house? You might have known that your sin would find you out, and now Jove\\r\\nand the other gods have punished you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from off a\\r\\nhigh mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a\\r\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder.[81] The sea quaked as the rock fell into\\r\\nit, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland,\\r\\nand forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the\\r\\nship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for\\r\\ntheir lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as\\r\\nwe were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and\\r\\nprayed of me to hold my tongue.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\\r\\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the\\r\\nmainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard\\r\\nany further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship’s\\r\\ntimbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he\\r\\ncan throw them a long way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage, ‘Cyclops,\\r\\nif any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty,\\r\\nsay it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncovered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought\\r\\nher by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’\\r\\nsaid I, ‘please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my\\r\\nhomeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering\\r\\nme with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the goddess answered, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of\\r\\nyou stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey\\r\\nwhich you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades and of dread Proserpine to consult the ghost of the blind Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, whose reason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine\\r\\nleft his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about\\r\\naimlessly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly\\r\\nhave lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was\\r\\ntired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, ‘And who shall guide me upon\\r\\nthis voyage—for the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise your mast, set your white\\r\\nsails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of itself. When\\r\\nyour ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore\\r\\nof Proserpine’s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed\\r\\ntheir fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go\\r\\nstraight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where\\r\\nthe rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)\\r\\nflow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring\\r\\nrivers run into one another.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or\\r\\nso in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all\\r\\nthe dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place\\r\\nwater—sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many\\r\\nprayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to\\r\\nIthaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will\\r\\nload the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\\r\\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your\\r\\nflocks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a\\r\\nram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away\\r\\nfrom them as though you would make towards the river. On this, many dead men’s\\r\\nghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that\\r\\nyou have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades\\r\\nand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any\\r\\nother poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias shall have\\r\\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you\\r\\nabout your voyage—what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea\\r\\nso as to reach your home.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my\\r\\nshirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric\\r\\nover her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she\\r\\ncovered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men everywhere all\\r\\nover the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man by man: ‘You must not lie\\r\\nsleeping here any longer,’ said I to them, ‘we must be going, for Circe has\\r\\ntold me all about it.’ And on this they did as I bade them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had with us\\r\\na certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who\\r\\nhad got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to\\r\\nsleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men bustling\\r\\nabout, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main\\r\\nstaircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul\\r\\nwent down to the house of Hades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had got the men together I said to them, ‘You think you are about to\\r\\nstart home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have\\r\\ngot to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the\\r\\nground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by\\r\\ncrying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe\\r\\nbrought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She passed\\r\\nthrough the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and\\r\\ngoings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XI\\n\\r\\nTHE VISIT TO THE DEAD.[88]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the water\\r\\nand got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on board and took\\r\\nour places, weeping and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and\\r\\ncunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and staid steadily with\\r\\nus keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing\\r\\nto the ship’s gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day\\r\\nlong her sails were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun\\r\\nwent down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of\\r\\nthe river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live\\r\\nenshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce neither\\r\\nat his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but the poor\\r\\nwretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there we beached the\\r\\nship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till\\r\\nwe came to the place of which Circe had told us.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug\\r\\nthe trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first\\r\\nwith honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled\\r\\nwhite barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless\\r\\nghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a\\r\\nbarren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good\\r\\nthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep\\r\\nto himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the\\r\\ndead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench,\\r\\nwhereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus—brides,[89] young bachelors, old men worn out\\r\\nwith toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been\\r\\nkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from\\r\\nevery quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming\\r\\nsound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men\\r\\nto be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt\\r\\nofferings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to\\r\\nProserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the\\r\\npoor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet\\r\\nbeen laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and unburied in\\r\\nCirce’s house, for we had had too much else to do. I was very sorry for him,\\r\\nand cried when I saw him: ‘Elpenor,’ said I, ‘how did you come down here into\\r\\nthis gloom and darkness? You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my\\r\\nship.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Sir,’ he answered with a groan, ‘it was all bad luck, and my own unspeakable\\r\\ndrunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe’s house, and never thought\\r\\nof coming down again by the great staircase but fell right off the roof and\\r\\nbroke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades. And now I beseech\\r\\nyou by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by\\r\\nyour wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child, and by\\r\\nTelemachus who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I\\r\\nknow that when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the\\r\\nAeaean island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or\\r\\nI may bring heaven’s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I have,\\r\\nbuild a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in days to come\\r\\nwhat a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row\\r\\nwith when I was yet alive and with my messmates.’ And I said, ‘My poor fellow,\\r\\nI will do all that you have asked of me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side\\r\\nof the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade\\r\\nsaying all this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost of my dead\\r\\nmother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I had left her alive when I set out for\\r\\nTroy and was moved to tears when I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I\\r\\nwould not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of\\r\\nTeiresias.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre in his\\r\\nhand. He knew me and said, ‘Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have\\r\\nyou left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?\\r\\nStand back from the trench and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the\\r\\nblood and answer your questions truly.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood\\r\\nhe began with his prophecy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You want to know,’ said he, ‘about your return home, but heaven will make\\r\\nthis hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of Neptune, who\\r\\nstill nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son. Still,\\r\\nafter much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your\\r\\ncompanions when your ship reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find\\r\\nthe sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything. If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of\\r\\ngetting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm\\r\\nthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\\r\\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing\\r\\nall your men, [in another man’s ship, and you will find trouble in your house,\\r\\nwhich will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your substance\\r\\nunder the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and after you\\r\\nhave killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must take a well made\\r\\noar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where the people have\\r\\nnever heard of the sea and do not even mix salt with their food, nor do they\\r\\nknow anything about ships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will\\r\\ngive you this certain token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will\\r\\nmeet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\\r\\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a\\r\\nbull, and a boar to Neptune.[90] Then go home and offer hecatombs to\\r\\nall the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come\\r\\nto you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full\\r\\nof years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you. All that I have\\r\\nsaid will come true].’[91]\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This,’ I answered, ‘must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me\\r\\nand tell me true, I see my poor mother’s ghost close by us; she is sitting by\\r\\nthe blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not\\r\\nremember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That,’ said he, ‘I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood\\r\\nwill talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any\\r\\nblood they will go away again.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for his\\r\\nprophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother\\r\\ncame up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me,\\r\\nsaying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are\\r\\nstill alive? It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between\\r\\nus and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\\r\\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all\\r\\nthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got\\r\\nback to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Neptune.\\r\\nShe bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. They were the\\r\\nfinest children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking, Orion\\r\\nonly excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high, and measured\\r\\nnine cubits round the chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in\\r\\nOlympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount\\r\\nPelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would\\r\\nhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\\r\\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks\\r\\nor chin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician\\r\\nMinos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens, but he did not enjoy\\r\\nher, for before he could do so Diana killed her in the island of Dia on account\\r\\nof what Bacchus had said against her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband\\r\\nfor gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name every single one of\\r\\nthe wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to go to\\r\\nbed, either on board ship with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and\\r\\nyourselves will see to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\\r\\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good looking,\\r\\nand is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the\\r\\ndistinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the\\r\\npresents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all\\r\\nof you with great abundance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among them, “My\\r\\nfriends,” said he, “what our august queen has just said to us is both\\r\\nreasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision\\r\\nwhether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinous.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The thing shall be done,” exclaimed Alcinous, “as surely as I still live and\\r\\nreign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home, still\\r\\nwe must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow, by which time I shall\\r\\nbe able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his\\r\\nescort it will be a matter for you all, and mine above all others as the chief\\r\\nperson among you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts,\\r\\nI should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage, for I\\r\\nshould return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected\\r\\nand beloved by all who see me when I get back to Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” replied Alcinous, “not one of us who sees you has any idea that you\\r\\nare a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people going about who\\r\\ntell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there\\r\\nis a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition.\\r\\nMoreover you have told the story of your own misfortunes, and those of the\\r\\nArgives, as though you were a practiced bard; but tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nwhether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with\\r\\nyourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it\\r\\nis not yet bed time—go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\\r\\nhere listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us\\r\\nof your adventures.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alcinous,” answered Ulysses, “there is a time for making speeches, and a time\\r\\nfor going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not refrain from\\r\\ntelling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall\\r\\nfighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery\\r\\nof a wicked woman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had\\r\\nperished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the\\r\\nblood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to\\r\\nembrace me; but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and\\r\\npitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you come by your death,’ said I, ‘King\\r\\nAgamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at\\r\\nsea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were\\r\\ncattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ he answered, ‘noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea in any\\r\\nstorm of Neptune’s raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the mainland, but\\r\\nAegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them. He asked me to\\r\\nhis house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a\\r\\nfat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like\\r\\nsheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some\\r\\ngreat nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\\r\\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly pitiable\\r\\nas the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the\\r\\nloaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard\\r\\nPriam’s daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I\\r\\nlay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to kill\\r\\nthe slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she would not even close\\r\\nmy lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so\\r\\ncruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers\\r\\nwas. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home\\r\\nby my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace\\r\\non herself and all women who shall come after—even on the good ones.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in\\r\\nthe matter of their women’s counsels. See how many of us fell for Helen’s sake,\\r\\nand now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your\\r\\nabsence.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Be sure, therefore,’ continued Agamemnon, ‘and not be too friendly even with\\r\\nyour own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell\\r\\nher a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that your wife,\\r\\nUlysses, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman, and\\r\\nhas an excellent nature. We left her a young bride with an infant at her breast\\r\\nwhen we set out for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man’s\\r\\nestate,[96] and he\\r\\nand his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is\\r\\nright they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the\\r\\nhappiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore\\r\\nI say—and lay my saying to your heart—do not tell people when you are bringing\\r\\nyour ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is\\r\\nno trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news\\r\\nof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with\\r\\nMenelaus—for I presume that he is still living.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is\\r\\nalive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not know.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax who was the finest\\r\\nand goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The fleet\\r\\ndescendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Ulysses, noble son\\r\\nof Laertes, what deed of daring will you undertake next, that you venture down\\r\\nto the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that\\r\\ncan labour no more?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I\\r\\ncame to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my return home\\r\\nto Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to\\r\\nset foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time. As for you,\\r\\nAchilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be,\\r\\nfor you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that\\r\\nyou are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it\\r\\nso much to heart even if you are dead.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Say not a word,’ he answered, ‘in death’s favour; I would rather be a paid\\r\\nservant in a poor man’s house and be above ground than king of kings among the\\r\\ndead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a\\r\\ngreat soldier, or is this not so? Tell me also if you have heard anything about\\r\\nmy father Peleus—does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no\\r\\nrespect throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him?\\r\\nCould I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that\\r\\nI had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy—could I but\\r\\nbe as I then was and go even for a short time to my father’s house, any one who\\r\\ntried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard nothing,’ I answered, ‘of Peleus, but I can tell you all about\\r\\nyour son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros with the\\r\\nAchaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always first to speak, and\\r\\nhis judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass\\r\\nhim; and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain\\r\\nwith the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all\\r\\nin valour. Many a man did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of\\r\\nthose whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say\\r\\nhow he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who was the\\r\\nhandsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell\\r\\naround him by reason of a woman’s bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the\\r\\nArgives went inside the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to\\r\\nsettle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it,\\r\\nthough all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their\\r\\neyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear\\r\\nfrom his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the\\r\\nhorse—grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\\r\\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his\\r\\nhandsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the fortune of\\r\\nwar) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat,\\r\\nfor the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow\\r\\nfull of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his\\r\\nson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy\\r\\ntale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still angry with me for\\r\\nhaving won the cause in our dispute about the armour of Achilles. Thetis had\\r\\noffered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges.\\r\\nWould that I had never gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life\\r\\nof Ajax, who was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\\r\\nstature and prowess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, ‘Ajax, will you not forget and\\r\\nforgive even in death, but must the judgement about that hateful armour still\\r\\nrankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of\\r\\nstrength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son\\r\\nof Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which\\r\\nJove bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your\\r\\ndestruction—come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection,\\r\\nand hear what I can tell you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\\r\\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry,\\r\\nor I should have gone on talking to him,[97] only that there were still others\\r\\namong the dead whom I desired to see.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in\\r\\njudgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round\\r\\nhim in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences upon them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of\\r\\nthe wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great\\r\\nbronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine\\r\\nacres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks\\r\\ninto his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but\\r\\ncould not; for he had violated Jove’s mistress Leto as she was going through\\r\\nPanopeus on her way to Pytho.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his\\r\\nchin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for\\r\\nwhenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that\\r\\nthere was nothing but dry ground—parched by the spite of heaven. There were\\r\\ntall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates,\\r\\napples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched\\r\\nout his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to the\\r\\nclouds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both\\r\\nhis hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill,\\r\\nbut always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its weight\\r\\nwould be too much for him, and the pitiless stone[98] would come thundering down again on\\r\\nto the plain. Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the\\r\\nsweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is\\r\\nfeasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is\\r\\ndaughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared\\r\\nbirds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with his bare bow in his\\r\\nhands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though ever on the point\\r\\nof taking aim. About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the\\r\\nmost marvellous fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes;\\r\\nthere was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he\\r\\nmight, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once\\r\\nwhen he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, ‘My poor Ulysses, noble son of\\r\\nLaertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was\\r\\nabove ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering,\\r\\nfor I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me—a low fellow who set me all\\r\\nmanner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound—for he did not\\r\\nthink he could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound out\\r\\nof Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I\\r\\nwas in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me. And I should have\\r\\nseen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have\\r\\nseen—Theseus and Pirithous—glorious children of the gods, but so many thousands\\r\\nof ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic\\r\\nstricken lest Proserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of\\r\\nthat awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my\\r\\nmen to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took\\r\\ntheir places, whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We\\r\\nhad to row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XII\\n\\r\\nTHE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the open sea,\\r\\nwe went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sun-rise\\r\\nas in other places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on\\r\\nto the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men\\r\\nto Circe’s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood\\r\\nwhere the headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and\\r\\nlamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armour had been\\r\\nburned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the\\r\\ncairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back from the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her\\r\\nmaid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then she stood\\r\\nin the midst of us and said, ‘You have done a bold thing in going down alive to\\r\\nthe house of Hades, and you will have died twice, to other people’s once; now,\\r\\nthen, stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your\\r\\nvoyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about\\r\\nyour course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering\\r\\nfrom misadventure either by land or sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day to the\\r\\ngoing down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men\\r\\nlaid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took\\r\\nme by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she reclined\\r\\nby my side and asked me all about our adventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘So far so good,’ said she, when I had ended my story, ‘and now pay attention\\r\\nto what I am about to tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your\\r\\nrecollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who come near\\r\\nthem. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the\\r\\nSirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit\\r\\nin a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song.\\r\\nThere is a great heap of dead men’s bones lying all around, with the flesh\\r\\nstill rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men’s\\r\\nears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\\r\\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross\\r\\npiece half way up the mast,[99] and they must lash the rope’s ends to\\r\\nthe mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and\\r\\npray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent\\r\\ndirections[100]\\r\\nas to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives\\r\\nbefore you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand there are\\r\\nsome overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat\\r\\nwith terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not\\r\\neven a bird may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to\\r\\nFather Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove\\r\\nhas to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to\\r\\nthese rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are\\r\\nfreighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only vessel that\\r\\never sailed and got through, was the famous Argo on her way from the house of\\r\\nAetes, and she too would have gone against these great rocks, only that Juno\\r\\npiloted her past them for the love she bore to Jason.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark\\r\\ncloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer\\r\\nand early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could get a\\r\\nfoothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had\\r\\nbeen polished. In the middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and\\r\\nturned towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so\\r\\nhigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside\\r\\nit Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young\\r\\nhound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one—not even a god—could\\r\\nface her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six\\r\\nnecks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck she has a\\r\\nfrightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together,\\r\\nso that they would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep\\r\\nwithin her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\\r\\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of\\r\\nthe thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her\\r\\nwithout losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries\\r\\noff a man in each mouth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are so close together that\\r\\nthere is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large fig tree in full\\r\\nleaf[101] grows\\r\\nupon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in\\r\\nthe day does she vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down\\r\\nagain; see that you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune\\r\\nhimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as\\r\\nfast as you can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Is there no way,’ said I, ‘of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time\\r\\nkeeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You dare devil,’ replied the goddess, ‘you are always wanting to fight\\r\\nsomebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the\\r\\nimmortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude,\\r\\ncruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get\\r\\nby her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock while you are\\r\\nputting on your armour, she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads,\\r\\nand snap up another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full\\r\\nspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla’s dam, bad luck to her;\\r\\nshe will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds\\r\\nof cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god—seven herds of cattle\\r\\nand seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not breed,\\r\\nnor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses\\r\\nPhaethusa and Lampetie, who are children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera.\\r\\nTheir mother when she had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to\\r\\nthe Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after\\r\\ntheir father’s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think\\r\\nof nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but\\r\\nif you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and\\r\\nof your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will return\\r\\nlate, in bad plight, after losing all your men.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon\\r\\nshe returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose the ship\\r\\nfrom her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, and began\\r\\nto smite the grey sea with their oars. Presently the great and cunning goddess\\r\\nCirce befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily\\r\\nwith us, keeping our sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the\\r\\nship’s gear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, ‘My friends, it is not\\r\\nright that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that Circe has\\r\\nmade me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live or die\\r\\nwe may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of the\\r\\nSirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I\\r\\nmight hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind\\r\\nme to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a\\r\\nbond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope’s ends to the\\r\\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly\\r\\nstill.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached the\\r\\nisland of the two Sirens,[102] for the wind had been very\\r\\nfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\\r\\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them;\\r\\nthen taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in\\r\\nrowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my\\r\\nsword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft, which it\\r\\nsoon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then\\r\\nI stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast\\r\\nas I stood upright on the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\\r\\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate,\\r\\nthe Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Come here,’ they sang, ‘renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean name, and\\r\\nlisten to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying to hear\\r\\nthe enchanting sweetness of our song—and he who listens will go on his way not\\r\\nonly charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the\\r\\nArgives and Trojans before Troy, and can tell you everything that is going to\\r\\nhappen over the whole world.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them further I\\r\\nmade signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free; but they\\r\\nquickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound me with still\\r\\nstronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the Sirens’ voices. Then my\\r\\nmen took the wax from their ears and unbound me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from which\\r\\nspray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so frightened\\r\\nthat they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resounded with the\\r\\nrushing of the waters,[103] but the ship stayed where it was,\\r\\nfor the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted them man\\r\\nby man not to lose heart.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘this is not the first time that we have been in danger,\\r\\nand we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops shut us up in his\\r\\ncave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved us then, and we shall\\r\\nlive to look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say,\\r\\ntrust in Jove and row on with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are\\r\\nyour orders; attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away\\r\\nfrom these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\\r\\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla,\\r\\nfor I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together\\r\\nin the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe’s strict instructions—I put\\r\\non my armour. Then seizing two strong spears I took my stand on the ship’s\\r\\nbows, for it was there that I expected first to see the monster of the rock,\\r\\nwho was to do my men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere,\\r\\nthough I strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand was\\r\\nScylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt water. As she\\r\\nvomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon\\r\\na great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side. When\\r\\nshe began to suck again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and\\r\\nround, and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could\\r\\nsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\\r\\nat their wits ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were\\r\\nexpecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and\\r\\nsnatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and\\r\\nin a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the\\r\\nair as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one\\r\\nlast despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting\\r\\nrock[104] throws\\r\\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the\\r\\nox’s horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as\\r\\nhe catches them one by one—even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on\\r\\nher rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and\\r\\nstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most\\r\\nsickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible Charybdis,\\r\\nwe reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and\\r\\nsheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear\\r\\nthe cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then\\r\\nI remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.\\r\\nSo being much troubled I said to the men, ‘My men, I know you are hard pressed,\\r\\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how\\r\\ncarefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for\\r\\nit was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship,\\r\\ntherefore, away from the island.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an insolent\\r\\nanswer. ‘Ulysses,’ said he, ‘you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and\\r\\nnever get worn out; you seem to be made of iron, and now, though your men are\\r\\nexhausted with toil and want of sleep, you will not let them land and cook\\r\\nthemselves a good supper upon this island, but bid them put out to sea and go\\r\\nfaring fruitlessly on through the watches of the flying night. It is by night\\r\\nthat the winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one\\r\\nof those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often wreck\\r\\na vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now, therefore, let us obey\\r\\nthe behests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to-morrow\\r\\nmorning we will go on board again and put out to sea.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that heaven meant\\r\\nus a mischief and said, ‘You force me to yield, for you are many against one,\\r\\nbut at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with\\r\\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a\\r\\nsingle head of either, but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given\\r\\nus.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath we made\\r\\nthe ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men\\r\\nwent ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\r\\ndrink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up\\r\\nand eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off\\r\\ninto a sound sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places, Jove\\r\\nraised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that land and sea were\\r\\ncovered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the\\r\\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and\\r\\ndrew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I\\r\\ncalled the men together in council.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said I, ‘we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind,\\r\\ntherefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these\\r\\ncattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to\\r\\neverything.’ And again they promised that they would obey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was no\\r\\nother wind, but only South and East.[105] As long as corn and wine held out\\r\\nthe men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had\\r\\neaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with\\r\\nhook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands\\r\\non; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might\\r\\npray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough\\r\\nto be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\\r\\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by and\\r\\nby they sent me off into a sweet sleep.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“I should have done so at once,” replied Neptune, “if I were not anxious to\\r\\navoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck\\r\\nthe Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from\\r\\nescorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a\\r\\nhuge mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very moment\\r\\nwhen the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into\\r\\na rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and\\r\\nyou can then bury their city under the mountain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the\\r\\nPhaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way,\\r\\nhad got close in. Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it\\r\\ndown with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he\\r\\nwent away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards\\r\\nhis neighbour, saying, “Bless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship\\r\\nin the sea just as she was getting into port? We could see the whole of her\\r\\nonly a moment ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous said, “I\\r\\nremember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that Neptune would be angry\\r\\nwith us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a\\r\\nPhaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a\\r\\nhigh mountain. This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all\\r\\ncoming true.[117]\\r\\nNow therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off\\r\\ngiving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice\\r\\ntwelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our\\r\\ncity under the high mountain.” When the people heard this they were afraid and\\r\\ngot ready the bulls.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune, standing\\r\\nround his altar; and at the same time[118] Ulysses woke up once more upon his\\r\\nown soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again; moreover,\\r\\nJove’s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know\\r\\nof his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his\\r\\nwife or his fellow citizens and friends recognising him[119] until he had taken his revenge upon\\r\\nthe wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him—the\\r\\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly trees,\\r\\nappeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land. So he\\r\\nsmote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas,” he exclaimed, “among what manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage\\r\\nand uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put all this treasure,\\r\\nand which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over there with the Phaeacians; or\\r\\nI could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and\\r\\ngiven me an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I\\r\\ncannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good\\r\\ntruth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by\\r\\nme, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to\\r\\nIthaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants chastise\\r\\nthem, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I\\r\\nsuppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but\\r\\nthere was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own\\r\\ncountry, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing\\r\\nhis hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of\\r\\ndelicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her\\r\\nshoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said he, “you are the first person whom I have met with in this\\r\\ncountry; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed towards me.\\r\\nProtect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and\\r\\ncountry is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea\\r\\nboard of some continent?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from\\r\\nsomewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is. It is a very\\r\\ncelebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a\\r\\ngood driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of\\r\\nit. It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain\\r\\nand dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and\\r\\nthere are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of\\r\\nIthaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off\\r\\nfrom this Achaean country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country,\\r\\nand he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and made up a lying\\r\\nstory in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I heard of Ithaca,” said he, “when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it\\r\\nseems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as much more\\r\\nbehind me for my children, but am flying because I killed Orsilochus son of\\r\\nIdomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob\\r\\nme of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on\\r\\nthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served\\r\\nhis father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\\r\\nruler, so I lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the road side, and\\r\\nspeared him as he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark\\r\\nnight and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him,\\r\\nbut as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were\\r\\nPhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the\\r\\nEpeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile,\\r\\nbut the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\\r\\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of us said\\r\\na word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay\\r\\ndown just as we were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took\\r\\nmy goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the\\r\\nsand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress\\r\\nof mind.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she\\r\\ntook the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, “He must be indeed a shifty\\r\\nlying fellow,” said she, “who could surpass you in all manner of craft even\\r\\nthough you had a god for your antagonist. Dare devil that you are, full of\\r\\nguile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive\\r\\nfalsehood, even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no\\r\\nmore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are\\r\\nthe most accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for\\r\\ndiplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know Jove’s\\r\\ndaughter Minerva—me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in\\r\\nall your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you?\\r\\nAnd now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to\\r\\nhide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the\\r\\ntroubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell\\r\\nno one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\\r\\nand put up with every man’s insolence, without a word.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so\\r\\nconstantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter\\r\\nfor him to know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know\\r\\nexceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting\\r\\nbefore Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship after having\\r\\nsacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw\\r\\nno more of you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a\\r\\ndifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from\\r\\nevil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took\\r\\nme into the town.[120] And now, I beseech you in your\\r\\nfather’s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\\r\\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in\\r\\nall you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own\\r\\ncountry?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are always taking something of that sort in your head,” replied Minerva,\\r\\n“and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible,\\r\\nshrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage\\r\\nwould at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem\\r\\nto care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have\\r\\nexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no\\r\\npeace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\\r\\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back\\r\\nsafely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with\\r\\nmy uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.[121] I will now,\\r\\nhowever, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps\\r\\nbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive\\r\\ntree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;[122] here too is\\r\\nthe overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to\\r\\nthe nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Ulysses\\r\\nrejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous\\r\\nsoil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, “Naiad nymphs,\\r\\ndaughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you, now therefore\\r\\nI greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in\\r\\nthe old days, if Jove’s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my\\r\\nson to manhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,” rejoined Minerva, “let us\\r\\nrather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be\\r\\nquite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places,\\r\\nwhile Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing\\r\\nwhich the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and\\r\\nMinerva set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the\\r\\nroot of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the\\r\\nwicked suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses,” said Minerva, “noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on\\r\\nthese disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three\\r\\nyears, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does\\r\\nnothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending encouraging messages[123] to every one\\r\\nof them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to\\r\\nmuch the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me\\r\\nsuch timely information. Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my\\r\\nside and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed Troy’s\\r\\nfair diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three\\r\\nhundred men, if you, goddess, will be with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Trust me for that,” said she, “I will not lose sight of you when once we set\\r\\nabout it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance\\r\\nwill then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin by\\r\\ndisguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover your body\\r\\nwith wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a\\r\\ngarment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine\\r\\neyes for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of\\r\\nyour wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the\\r\\nswineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected\\r\\ntowards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding\\r\\nhis pigs near the rock that is called Raven[124] by the fountain Arethusa, where\\r\\nthey are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with\\r\\nhim and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your\\r\\nson, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out\\r\\nwhether you are still alive.”[125]\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why,” said Ulysses, “did you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did\\r\\nyou want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others\\r\\nare eating up his estate?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be well\\r\\nspoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite\\r\\ncomfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The\\r\\nsuitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to\\r\\nkill him before he can get home. I do not much think they will succeed, but\\r\\nrather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a\\r\\ngrave themselves.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEumaeus answered, “Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will get\\r\\nUlysses’ wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a\\r\\nlodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth;\\r\\nevery one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress and tells her\\r\\nfalsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks them all\\r\\nmanner of questions, crying all the time as women will when they have lost\\r\\ntheir husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless\\r\\nmake up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\\r\\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones\\r\\nare lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and\\r\\na bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go where I may I\\r\\nshall never find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother\\r\\nand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my\\r\\nparents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own country;\\r\\nit is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without\\r\\nreverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond of me, and took\\r\\nsuch care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” replied Ulysses, “you are very positive, and very hard of belief\\r\\nabout your master’s coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say, but\\r\\nwill swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my news till he has\\r\\nactually come, you may then give me a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will.\\r\\nI am in great want, but I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a\\r\\nman, even as I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\\r\\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses\\r\\nto which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will.\\r\\nUlysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\r\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill\\r\\ntreating his wife and son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Old man, you will neither get paid\\r\\nfor bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in\\r\\npeace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all\\r\\nthis; it always pains me when any one speaks about my honoured master. As for\\r\\nyour oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope,\\r\\nhis old father Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about\\r\\nthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be\\r\\nno worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or\\r\\nman, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get\\r\\nnews of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\r\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca.\\r\\nBut let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape\\r\\nif the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,\\r\\ntell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and where\\r\\nyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came\\r\\nin, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what country they professed to\\r\\ncome—for you cannot have come by land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “I will tell you all about it. If there were meat and\\r\\nwine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat\\r\\nand drink while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole\\r\\ntwelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has\\r\\npleased heaven to visit me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many sons born\\r\\nin marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a\\r\\nconcubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage I claim,\\r\\nand who was held in the highest honour among the Cretans for his wealth,\\r\\nprosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me on the same level with my\\r\\nbrothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however, death took him to the\\r\\nhouse of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but\\r\\nto me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me\\r\\nto marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on\\r\\nthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you\\r\\ncan see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\r\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy\\r\\nwith an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to\\r\\nleap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I\\r\\ndid not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\\r\\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things\\r\\nthat most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another\\r\\nanother, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the\\r\\nAchaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign\\r\\nservice, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first\\r\\ninstance, and much more was allotted to me later on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove\\r\\ncounselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people\\r\\nrequired me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there was no way out\\r\\nof it, for they insisted on our doing so. There we fought for nine whole years,\\r\\nbut in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven\\r\\ndispersed us. Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one\\r\\nmonth happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the\\r\\nidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.\\r\\nI had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my\\r\\nmen made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\r\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail from\\r\\nCrete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a river.\\r\\nNothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but\\r\\nsat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On\\r\\nthe fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\\r\\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out\\r\\nscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\n---------new doc---------\\nBOOK XV\\n\\r\\nMINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS AT PYLOS\\r\\nAND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA—ON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses’ son that he\\r\\nwas to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt\\r\\nof Menelaus’s house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but Telemachus could get no\\r\\nrest all night for thinking of his unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to\\r\\nhim and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer, nor leave\\r\\nyour property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up\\r\\neverything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand. Ask\\r\\nMenelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother\\r\\nstill there when you get back. Her father and brothers are already urging her\\r\\nto marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any of the others, and has\\r\\nbeen greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\\r\\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they\\r\\nalways want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never\\r\\ngive another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their\\r\\nfather either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put\\r\\neverything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until\\r\\nit shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of\\r\\nanother matter which you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors\\r\\nare lying in wait for you in the Strait[128] between Ithaca and Samos, and they\\r\\nmean to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\\r\\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your\\r\\nproperty will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship\\r\\nwell away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will\\r\\nsend you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on to\\r\\nthe town, but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your\\r\\npigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night,\\r\\nand then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from\\r\\nPylos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with his heel\\r\\nto rouse him, and said, “Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the horses to the\\r\\nchariot, for we must set off home.”[129]\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Pisistratus said, “No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the\\r\\ndark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought his presents and\\r\\nput them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to us in the usual\\r\\nway. So long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him\\r\\nkindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen, leaving\\r\\nHelen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put on his shirt as\\r\\nfast as he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to meet\\r\\nhim. “Menelaus,” said he, “let me go back now to my own country, for I want to\\r\\nget home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Menelaus answered, “Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not detain\\r\\nyou. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to\\r\\nhim. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he wants\\r\\nto do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay. One should\\r\\ntreat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to\\r\\nleave it. Wait, then, till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot,\\r\\nand till you have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\\r\\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a\\r\\nlong journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in Hellas or in\\r\\nthe Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you myself through all\\r\\nour principal cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will\\r\\ngive us something—a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Menelaus,” replied Telemachus, “I want to go home at once, for when I came\\r\\naway I left my property without protection, and fear that while looking for my\\r\\nfather I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been\\r\\nstolen during my absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a\\r\\nsufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At this moment\\r\\nEteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaus\\r\\ntold him to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then\\r\\nMenelaus went down into his fragrant store room,[130] not alone, but Helen went too, with\\r\\nMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his house were\\r\\nkept, he selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a\\r\\nsilver mixing bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely\\r\\ndresses which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was\\r\\nlargest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a\\r\\nstar, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. [131] Then they all came back through the\\r\\nhouse again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said, “Telemachus, may\\r\\nJove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely home according to your\\r\\ndesire. I will now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate\\r\\nin all my house. It is a mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is\\r\\ninlaid with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\\r\\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on\\r\\nmy return home. I should like to give it to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus, while\\r\\nMegapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before him. Hard by\\r\\nstood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I too, my son,” said she, “have something for you as a keepsake from the hand\\r\\nof Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day. Till then, get\\r\\nyour dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own\\r\\ncountry and to your home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the son of\\r\\nNisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors\\r\\nfrom the wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation,\\r\\nmoreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the other suitors,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good natural disposition. “My friends,” said he, speaking\\r\\nto them plainly and in all honestly, “I am not in favour of killing Telemachus.\\r\\nIt is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take\\r\\ncounsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to\\r\\nkill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us,\\r\\nI would have you hold your hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and\\r\\nwent to the house of Ulysses, where they took their accustomed seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She knew of\\r\\nthe plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had overheard their counsels\\r\\nand had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens,\\r\\nand when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts\\r\\nsupporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked\\r\\nAntinous saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best speaker and\\r\\ncounsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are nothing of the kind.\\r\\nMadman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, and take no heed\\r\\nof suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot\\r\\nthus against one another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this\\r\\nhouse in fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\\r\\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us?\\r\\nThey wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses\\r\\nstayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his wife and\\r\\ntrying to kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, “Take heart, Queen Penelope\\r\\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters. The man\\r\\nis not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son\\r\\nTelemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time\\r\\nhas Ulysses taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put\\r\\npieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I\\r\\nhave, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death\\r\\ncomes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her,\\r\\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva shed\\r\\nsleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses and his son,\\r\\nwho had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another\\r\\nto get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an\\r\\nold man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for\\r\\nfear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret, but go and\\r\\ntell Penelope.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,” said he.\\r\\n“What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are they still\\r\\nwaiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not think of asking about that,” replied Eumaeus, “when I was in the\\r\\ntown. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met\\r\\na man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos, and he was the first to\\r\\ntell the news to your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had\\r\\njust got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a\\r\\nship coming into harbour with a number of men in her. They had many shields and\\r\\nspears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus could not\\r\\nsee him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they ate it,\\r\\nand every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they\\r\\nhad had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET—ULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE TOWN, AND\\r\\nULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS—HE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG ARGOS—HE IS\\r\\nINSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A STOOL—PENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE\\r\\nSHALL BE SENT TO HER.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on\\r\\nhis sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go\\r\\ninto the city. “Old friend,” said he to the swineherd, “I will now go to the\\r\\ntown and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till\\r\\nshe has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let\\r\\nhim beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have\\r\\ntrouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this\\r\\nmakes him angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said, “Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do\\r\\nbetter in town than country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am\\r\\ntoo old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.\\r\\nTherefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as\\r\\nsoon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it.\\r\\nMy clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished\\r\\nwith cold, for you say the city is some way off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the\\r\\nsuitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the\\r\\ncloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting the\\r\\nfleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the\\r\\nother maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.\\r\\nPenelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus, and wept as she\\r\\nflung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful\\r\\neyes, “Light of my eyes,” she cried as she spoke fondly to him, “so you are\\r\\ncome home again; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of\\r\\nyour having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my\\r\\nconsent. But come, tell me what you saw.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“This hound,” answered Eumaeus, “belonged to him who has died in a far country.\\r\\nIf he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what\\r\\nhe could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from\\r\\nhim when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for\\r\\nhis master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never\\r\\ndo their work when their master’s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes\\r\\nhalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors\\r\\nwere, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him to come\\r\\nand sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the\\r\\ncarver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought\\r\\nit to Telemachus’s table, and sat down opposite him. Then the servant brought\\r\\nhim his portion, and gave him bread from the bread-basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable old\\r\\nbeggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon\\r\\nthe threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the\\r\\ninner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had\\r\\nskilfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus\\r\\ntook a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in\\r\\nhis two hands, and said to Eumaeus, “Take this to the stranger, and tell him to\\r\\ngo the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, “Stranger, Telemachus sends you this, and\\r\\nsays you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be\\r\\nshamefaced.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus, and fulfil\\r\\nthe desire of his heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it on the\\r\\ndirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing,\\r\\nand had just finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the\\r\\nbard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of\\r\\nbread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they\\r\\nwere, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to\\r\\nsave a single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from\\r\\nleft to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\\r\\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another\\r\\nwho he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius said,\\r\\n“Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have\\r\\nseen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing about the\\r\\nman himself, nor where he comes from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. “You precious idiot,” he cried,\\r\\n“what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars\\r\\nenough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing\\r\\nthat such people gather here to waste your master’s property—and must you needs\\r\\nbring this man as well?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Antinous, your birth is good but your words evil. It was\\r\\nno doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a\\r\\nforeign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer,\\r\\na healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his singing?\\r\\nSuch men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar\\r\\nwho will only worry him. You are always harder on Ulysses’ servants than any of\\r\\nthe other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as\\r\\nTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Telemachus said, “Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\\r\\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Antinous he said, “Antinous, you take as much care of my\\r\\ninterests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this stranger\\r\\nturned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him\\r\\nyourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any\\r\\nof the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I say, for\\r\\nyou are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other\\r\\npeople.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, Telemachus,” replied Antinous, “by this swaggering talk? If\\r\\nall the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here\\r\\nagain for another three months.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the\\r\\ntable, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors\\r\\nall gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was\\r\\nabout, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had\\r\\ngiven him, but he first went up to Antinous and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to\\r\\nbe a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver,\\r\\nand I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich man once, and had\\r\\na fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am,\\r\\nno matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and\\r\\nall the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\\r\\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving\\r\\nrobbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I stationed my\\r\\nships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over\\r\\nthem, while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the\\r\\nwar-cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with\\r\\nsoldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic\\r\\namong my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\\r\\nthemselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive\\r\\nto do forced labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met\\r\\nthem, to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in\\r\\nCyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Antinous said, “What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us\\r\\nduring our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,[145] or I will give\\r\\nyou Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have\\r\\nbegged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have\\r\\nabundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people’s property\\r\\nwhen there is plenty of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, “You wretch, I\\r\\nwill soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too.\\r\\nHas the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?\\r\\nYou seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Irus.” With this he\\r\\ncaught hold of a footstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of\\r\\nAmphinomus of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his\\r\\nright hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and\\r\\nhis wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\\r\\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying, “I\\r\\nwish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to him, for all the trouble\\r\\nhe gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such ill\\r\\ncounsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, “Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry\\r\\nyour meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do\\r\\nnot wish to drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the\\r\\nsooner you all go home to bed the better.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; but\\r\\nAmphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, “Do not let us take\\r\\noffence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer. Neither let us do violence\\r\\nto the stranger nor to any of Ulysses’ servants. Let the cupbearer go round\\r\\nwith the drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house\\r\\nthat he has come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of Dulichium,\\r\\nservant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round\\r\\nto each of them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the\\r\\nblessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each\\r\\none as he was minded, they took their several ways each of them to his own\\r\\nabode.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\r\\nTELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR—ULYSSES INTERVIEWS PENELOPE—EURYCLEA\\r\\nWASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS LEG—PENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO\\r\\nULYSSES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it down inside. Make some\\r\\nexcuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it. Say that you have\\r\\ntaken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it\\r\\nwas when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add\\r\\nto this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\\r\\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace\\r\\nboth banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse Euryclea\\r\\nand said, “Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I take the armour that\\r\\nmy father left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now\\r\\nmy father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood.\\r\\nI want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish, child,” answered Euryclea, “that you would take the management of the\\r\\nhouse into your own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself.\\r\\nBut who is to go with you and light you to the store-room? The maids would have\\r\\ndone so, but you would not let them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The stranger,” said Telemachus, “shall show me a light; when people eat my\\r\\nbread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room. Then\\r\\nUlysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears\\r\\ninside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a\\r\\nsoft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said, “Father, my eyes behold a\\r\\ngreat marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on\\r\\nwhich they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god\\r\\nhere who has come down from heaven.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush,” answered Ulysses, “hold your peace and ask no questions, for this is\\r\\nthe manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here to talk with\\r\\nyour mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will ask me all sorts of\\r\\nquestions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to\\r\\nthe room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while\\r\\nUlysses was left in the cloister pondering on the means whereby with Minerva’s\\r\\nhelp he might be able to kill the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and they set\\r\\nher a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her\\r\\naccustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a footstool all in one\\r\\npiece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a thick fleece: on this she\\r\\nnow sat, and the maids came from the women’s room to join her. They set about\\r\\nremoving the tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away\\r\\nthe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\\r\\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to give both\\r\\nlight and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,\\r\\n“Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and\\r\\nspying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat your supper there,\\r\\nor you shall be driven out with a firebrand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, “My good woman, why should you be so angry\\r\\nwith me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and\\r\\nbecause I am obliged to go begging about after the manner of tramps and beggars\\r\\ngenerally? I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\\r\\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor\\r\\nwhat he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which\\r\\npeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to\\r\\ntake all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come to lose that\\r\\npride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest\\r\\nyou get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come home,\\r\\nfor there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as\\r\\nyou think he is, yet by Apollo’s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus,\\r\\nwho will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no\\r\\nlonger in his boyhood.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer’s foot from the meat-basket in which it lay,\\r\\nand threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little aside, and\\r\\navoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion[159] as he did so, and it hit the wall,\\r\\nnot him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Ctesippus, “It is a good thing\\r\\nfor you,” said he, “that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him.\\r\\nIf you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father\\r\\nwould have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this\\r\\nhouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\\r\\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,\\r\\ninstead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you\\r\\nkilling my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have put up with\\r\\nthis, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence. Still,\\r\\nif you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather die than see such\\r\\ndisgraceful scenes day after day—guests insulted, and men dragging the women\\r\\nservants about the house in an unseemly way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said, “No one\\r\\nshould take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite\\r\\nreasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the stranger, or any one else of\\r\\nthe servants who are about the house; I would say, however, a friendly word to\\r\\nTelemachus and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both. ‘As long,’\\r\\nI would say, ‘as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come\\r\\nhome, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering[160] the suitors to\\r\\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but\\r\\nit is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this\\r\\nquietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one\\r\\nwho makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able to\\r\\nmanage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother\\r\\nwill look after some other man’s house, not yours.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Telemachus answered, “By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my\\r\\nunhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is wandering in\\r\\nsome distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother’s marriage; on\\r\\nthe contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her\\r\\nnumberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she\\r\\nshall leave the house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do\\r\\nthis.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set their wits\\r\\nwandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became\\r\\nsmeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy\\r\\nwith forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and said, “Unhappy men, what is it that\\r\\nails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your\\r\\ncheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and\\r\\nroof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\\r\\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of\\r\\nheaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus then said,\\r\\n“This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him\\r\\nout into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Theoclymenus said, “Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me. I have\\r\\neyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding\\r\\nmind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief\\r\\noverhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and\\r\\nplotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome,\\r\\nbut the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking Telemachus by\\r\\nlaughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, “Telemachus, you\\r\\nare not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who comes\\r\\nbegging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is\\r\\nperfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as\\r\\na prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board\\r\\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting\\r\\nevery moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed\\r\\nfor her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one\\r\\nwas saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment; it had\\r\\nbeen both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims; but the\\r\\nsupper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the\\r\\nmeal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them—for they had\\r\\nbrought their doom upon themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\r\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS AND\\r\\nPHILOETIUS\\n---------new doc---------\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table[165]—for those which the Achaeans were\\r\\nso shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver—he laid it on the\\r\\ncentre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward\\r\\nhim, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow\\r\\npierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till\\r\\nit had gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to\\r\\nTelemachus:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I aimed at,\\r\\nand I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the\\r\\nsuitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to\\r\\nprepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to disport\\r\\nthemselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his\\r\\nsword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father’s seat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\r\\nTHE KILLING OF THE SUITORS—THE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES ARE MADE\\r\\nTO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement with his\\r\\nbow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his\\r\\nfeet and said, “The mighty contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo\\r\\nwill vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a\\r\\ntwo-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands. He had\\r\\nno thought of death—who amongst all the revellers would think that one man,\\r\\nhowever brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck\\r\\nAntinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he\\r\\nfell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood\\r\\ngushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on\\r\\nit, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to\\r\\nthe ground.[166]\\r\\nThe suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they\\r\\nsprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere\\r\\ntowards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked\\r\\nUlysses very angrily. “Stranger,” said they, “you shall pay for shooting people\\r\\nin this way: you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you\\r\\nhave slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you\\r\\nfor having killed him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and\\r\\ndid not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But\\r\\nUlysses glared at them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have wasted my\\r\\nsubstance,[167]\\r\\nhave forced my women servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I\\r\\nwas still living. You have feared neither God nor man, and now you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see\\r\\nwhither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you are Ulysses,” said he, “then what you have said is just. We have done\\r\\nmuch wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who was the head and\\r\\nfront of the offending lies low already. It was all his doing. It was not that\\r\\nhe wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so much care about that; what he wanted\\r\\nwas something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted\\r\\nto kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met\\r\\nthe death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\\r\\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten\\r\\nand drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will\\r\\nkeep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened. Until we have\\r\\ndone this no one can complain of your being enraged against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses again glared at him and said, “Though you should give me all that you\\r\\nhave in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my\\r\\nhand till I have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or fly for your\\r\\nlives; and fly, not a man of you shall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he is and\\r\\nshoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then show fight;\\r\\ndraw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us\\r\\nhave at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can\\r\\nthen get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with\\r\\na loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his\\r\\nbreast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped\\r\\nhis sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went\\r\\nover on to the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of\\r\\ndeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him\\r\\naway from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him, and struck him from\\r\\nbehind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his\\r\\nchest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his\\r\\nforehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the\\r\\nbody, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans\\r\\nmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off\\r\\nat a run, and immediately was at his father’s side. Then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your\\r\\ntemples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour for the\\r\\nswineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Run and fetch them,” answered Ulysses, “while my arrows hold out, or when I am\\r\\nalone they may get me away from the door.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the\\r\\narmour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets\\r\\nwith horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed\\r\\nhimself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour,\\r\\nand took their places near Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows\\r\\nlasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one\\r\\nanother: when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall\\r\\nof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his\\r\\nshoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of\\r\\nhorse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,[168] and he grasped two redoubtable\\r\\nbronze-shod spears.\\n---------new doc---------\\nNow there was a trap door[169] on the wall, while at one end of\\r\\nthe pavement[170]\\r\\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a\\r\\nwell-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for\\r\\nonly one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, “Cannot\\r\\nsome one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on? Help\\r\\nwould come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his\\r\\nshooting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This may not be, Agelaus,” answered Melanthius, “the mouth of the narrow\\r\\npassage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man\\r\\ncould prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will\\r\\nbring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and\\r\\nhis son have put them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room of\\r\\nUlysses’ house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears,\\r\\nand brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors. Ulysses’\\r\\nheart began to fail him when he saw the suitors[171] putting on their armour and\\r\\nbrandishing their spears. He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to\\r\\nTelemachus, “Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or\\r\\nit may be Melanthius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the\\r\\nstore room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have. Go,\\r\\nEumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing\\r\\nthis, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the son of Dolius.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the store room\\r\\nto fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was\\r\\nbeside him, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel Melanthius,\\r\\njust as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if\\r\\nI can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your\\r\\nown revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter\\r\\nwhat they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius’ hands and feet behind\\r\\nhim. Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then\\r\\nfasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters from a\\r\\nhigh bearing-post,[172] that he may linger on in an agony.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to the store\\r\\nroom, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was busy searching\\r\\nfor arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on\\r\\neither side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet\\r\\nin one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by\\r\\nLaertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\\r\\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back by the\\r\\nhair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well\\r\\nbehind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told\\r\\nthem; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high\\r\\npillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O\\r\\nswineherd Eumaeus saying, “Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as\\r\\nyou deserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of\\r\\nOceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to\\r\\nfeast on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their\\r\\narmour they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by\\r\\nthe side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce and\\r\\nfull of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still\\r\\nboth brave and many. Then Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having\\r\\nassumed the voice and form of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and\\r\\nsaid, “Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many\\r\\ngood turns he has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the other\\r\\nside raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to reproach her.\\r\\n“Mentor,” he cried, “do not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him and\\r\\nfighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when we have killed these\\r\\npeople, father and son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your\\r\\nhead, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out,\\r\\nand bring it into hotch-pot with Ulysses’ property; we will not let your sons\\r\\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live\\r\\nin the city of Ithaca.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily.[173] “Ulysses,”\\r\\nsaid she, “your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you\\r\\nfought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You\\r\\nkilled many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam’s\\r\\ncity was taken. How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that\\r\\nyou are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?\\r\\nCome on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcimus\\r\\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to\\r\\nprove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the\\r\\nrafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\\r\\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the\\r\\nsuitors’ side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were\\r\\nby far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of\\r\\nUlysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said, “My friends, he will soon have to\\r\\nleave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.\\r\\nThey are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but\\r\\nsix of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with\\r\\nglory by killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\\r\\nothers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of no\\r\\neffect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft\\r\\nof another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of\\r\\nthe suitors Ulysses said to his own men, “My friends, I should say we too had\\r\\nbetter let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they\\r\\nhave done us by killing us outright.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears. Ulysses\\r\\nkilled Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockman\\r\\nkilled Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a\\r\\ncorner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing\\r\\nthem from the bodies of the dead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for\\r\\nthe most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the cloister; another\\r\\nwent against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall.\\r\\nStill, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus’s\\r\\nwrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze Eumaeus’s shoulder above his shield; but\\r\\nthe spear went on and fell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive\\r\\ninto the crowd of suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and\\r\\nEumaeus Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\\r\\ntaunted him saying, “Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so foolish as\\r\\nto talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods\\r\\nare far stronger than men. I make you a present of this advice to repay you for\\r\\nthe foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging about in his own house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a spear in\\r\\nclose fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the\\r\\ndart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the\\r\\nground. Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and\\r\\nthe hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like\\r\\na herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at\\r\\ntheir longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop\\r\\ndown on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,\\r\\nfor they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport—even so did\\r\\nUlysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They\\r\\nmade a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground\\r\\nseethed with their blood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, “Ulysses I beseech you have\\r\\nmercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house\\r\\neither in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they\\r\\nwould not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was their\\r\\nsacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to\\r\\ndeserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, “If you were their sacrificing\\r\\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got\\r\\nhome again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.\\r\\nTherefore you shall die.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when he was\\r\\nbeing killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on\\r\\nthe back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was\\r\\nyet speaking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he who had been forced by the suitors to\\r\\nsing to them—now tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap\\r\\ndoor,[174] and\\r\\nheld his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to fly out of the cloister\\r\\nand sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which\\r\\nboth Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or\\r\\nwhether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\\r\\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses’ knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground\\r\\nbetween the mixing bowl [175] and the silver-studded seat; then\\r\\ngoing up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, “Ulysses, I beseech\\r\\nyou have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards if you\\r\\nkill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays\\r\\nmyself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to\\r\\nyou as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my\\r\\nhead off. Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent\\r\\nyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\\r\\nand too strong for me, so they made me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. “Hold!” he cried, “the\\r\\nman is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always\\r\\ngood to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has already killed\\r\\nhim, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat\\r\\nbeneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed\\r\\nheifer’s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid hold\\r\\nof his knees.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here I am, my dear sir,” said he, “stay your hand therefore, and tell your\\r\\nfather, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted\\r\\nhis substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, “Fear not; Telemachus has saved your life,\\r\\nthat you may know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good\\r\\ndeeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the\\r\\nouter court, and be out of the way of the slaughter—you and the bard—while I\\r\\nfinish my work here inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down by\\r\\nJove’s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they\\r\\nwould be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over, to see\\r\\nif anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them\\r\\nall lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which\\r\\nfishermen have netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping\\r\\nfor water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the\\r\\nsuitors lying all huddled up one against the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, “Call nurse Euryclea; I have something to say\\r\\nto her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women’s room. “Make haste,” said\\r\\nhe, “you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house.\\r\\nCome outside; my father wishes to speak to you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women’s room and came\\r\\nout, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast\\r\\nand both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was\\r\\nUlysses besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses\\r\\nand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw\\r\\nthat a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, “Old woman,” said he,\\r\\n“rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it\\r\\nis an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven’s doom and their own evil\\r\\ndeeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the\\r\\nwhole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a\\r\\nbad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me\\r\\nwhich of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are\\r\\ninnocent.”[176]\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you the truth, my son,” answered Euryclea. “There are fifty women\\r\\nin the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of\\r\\nhousehold work. Of these, twelve in all[177] have misbehaved, and have been\\r\\nwanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to\\r\\nTelemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to\\r\\ngive orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife\\r\\nall that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not wake her yet,” answered Ulysses, “but tell the women who have\\r\\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses; in\\r\\nthe meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the swineherd. “Begin,”\\r\\nsaid he, “to remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges\\r\\nand clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have thoroughly\\r\\ncleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed\\r\\nroom and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords\\r\\ntill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in\\r\\nwhich they used to lie in secret with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they\\r\\ncarried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the\\r\\ngatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so\\r\\nthey had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they cleaned all the\\r\\ntables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others\\r\\nshovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all\\r\\naway and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite\\r\\nclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space\\r\\nbetween the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not\\r\\nget away: and Telemachus said to the other two, “I shall not let these women\\r\\ndie a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to\\r\\nsleep with the suitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo saying he made a ship’s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that\\r\\nsupported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building,\\r\\nat a good height, lest any of the women’s feet should touch the ground; and as\\r\\nthrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket\\r\\njust as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even\\r\\nso did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die\\r\\nmost miserably.[178] Their feet moved convulsively for a\\r\\nwhile, but not for very long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner court.\\r\\nThere they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave\\r\\nthem to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the\\r\\nhouse, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Euryclea,\\r\\n“Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may\\r\\nburn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here\\r\\nwith her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All that you have said is true,” answered Euryclea, “but let me bring you some\\r\\nclean clothes—a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any\\r\\nlonger. It is not right.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First light me a fire,” replied Ulysses.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly\\r\\npurified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went\\r\\ninside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came\\r\\nfrom their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to\\r\\nembrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It\\r\\nmade him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of\\r\\nthem.[179]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\r\\nPENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND—EARLY IN THE MORNING ULYSSES,\\r\\nTELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband\\r\\nhad come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for\\r\\njoy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.\\r\\n“Wake up Penelope, my dear child,” she exclaimed, “and see with your own eyes\\r\\nsomething that you have been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last\\r\\nindeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much\\r\\ntrouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill treating his son.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My good nurse,” answered Penelope, “you must be mad. The gods sometimes send\\r\\nsome very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become\\r\\nsensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you always used to\\r\\nbe a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough\\r\\nalready—talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had\\r\\ntaken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from\\r\\nthe day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\\r\\nagain into the women’s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to\\r\\nbring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe scolding.\\r\\nAs it is your age shall protect you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear child,” answered Euryclea, “I am not mocking you. It is quite true as\\r\\nI tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all\\r\\nkept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus knew all the time that he\\r\\nwas come back, but kept his father’s secret that he might have his revenge on\\r\\nall these wicked people.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea, and wept\\r\\nfor joy. “But my dear nurse,” said she, “explain this to me; if he has really\\r\\ncome home as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single\\r\\nhanded, seeing what a number of them there always were?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was not there,” answered Euryclea, “and do not know; I only heard them\\r\\ngroaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a\\r\\ncorner of the women’s room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch\\r\\nme because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses\\r\\nthat were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other. You would\\r\\nhave enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with\\r\\nblood and filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all\\r\\npiled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\\r\\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call you, so\\r\\ncome with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the\\r\\ndesire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both\\r\\nwife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the\\r\\nsuitors who behaved so badly to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “do not exult too confidently over all this.\\r\\nYou know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come home—more\\r\\nparticularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but what you\\r\\ntell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry with the suitors for\\r\\ntheir great wickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man\\r\\nin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have\\r\\ncome to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away\\r\\nfrom the Achaean land; he will never return home again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen nurse Euryclea said, “My child, what are you talking about? but you were\\r\\nall hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never\\r\\ncoming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very\\r\\nmoment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I was washing him I\\r\\nperceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about\\r\\nit, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth;\\r\\nso come with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you,\\r\\nyou may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear nurse,” said Penelope, “however wise you may be you can hardly fathom\\r\\nthe counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I\\r\\nmay see the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered\\r\\nwhether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or\\r\\nwhether she should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the\\r\\nfire, against the wall at right angles[180] [to that by which she had entered],\\r\\nwhile Ulysses sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and\\r\\nwaiting to see what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a\\r\\nlong time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\\r\\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his shabby\\r\\nclothes and failed to recognise him,[181] till Telemachus began to reproach\\r\\nher and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother—but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why do you\\r\\nkeep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin\\r\\ntalking to him and asking him questions? No other woman could bear to keep away\\r\\nfrom her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\\r\\nand after having gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a\\r\\nstone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope answered, “My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no\\r\\nwords in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look\\r\\nhim straight in the face. Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his own\\r\\nhome again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there\\r\\nare tokens with which we two are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from\\r\\nall others.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, “Let your mother put me to any\\r\\nproof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me\\r\\nfor the moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with\\r\\ndirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better\\r\\ndo next. When one man has killed another—even though he was not one who would\\r\\nleave many friends to take up his quarrel—the man who has killed him must still\\r\\nsay good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\\r\\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you\\r\\nconsider this matter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look to it yourself, father,” answered Telemachus, “for they say you are the\\r\\nwisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can\\r\\ncompare with you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find\\r\\nus fail you in so far as our strength holds out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will say what I think will be best,” answered Ulysses. “First wash and put\\r\\nyour shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemius\\r\\nshall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,\\r\\nor any of the neighbours, or some one going along the street happens to notice\\r\\nit, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the\\r\\ndeath of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the\\r\\nwoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\\r\\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed and put\\r\\ntheir shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took his lyre and set\\r\\nthem all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with the\\r\\nsound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, “I suppose the\\r\\nqueen has been getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for\\r\\nnot continuing to protect her husband’s property until he comes home.”[182]\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made\\r\\nthe bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse\\r\\nwent back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman\\r\\nEurynome[183] to\\r\\nshow Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to\\r\\ntheir room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own\\r\\nold bed. Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\\r\\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the\\r\\ncloisters.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one\\r\\nanother. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled\\r\\nwith a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her\\r\\naccount, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what\\r\\nhe had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He\\r\\ntold her everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to\\r\\nsleep till he had ended his whole story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached the\\r\\nfertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops and how he\\r\\nhad punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how he then\\r\\nwent on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way,\\r\\nbut even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane\\r\\ncarried him out to sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city\\r\\nTelepylos, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save\\r\\nhimself and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and\\r\\nhow he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban\\r\\nprophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who\\r\\nbore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the wondrous\\r\\nsinging of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible\\r\\nCharybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men\\r\\nthen ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with\\r\\nhis thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being\\r\\nleft alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso,\\r\\nwho kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\\r\\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering\\r\\nhe had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had\\r\\nbeen a god, and sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given\\r\\nhim gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about\\r\\nwhich he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that Ulysses had\\r\\nhad both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of\\r\\nOceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his\\r\\ncomfortable bed and said to Penelope, “Wife, we have both of us had our full\\r\\nshare of troubles, you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented\\r\\nfrom getting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,\\r\\nthat we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\\r\\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will\\r\\ntake many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to\\r\\nmake good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to\\r\\nthe wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been\\r\\ngrieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though\\r\\nyou have little need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have\\r\\nbeen killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore,[184] and stay there with your women. See\\r\\nnobody and ask no questions.”[185]\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and\\r\\nEumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they did, and\\r\\narmed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied\\r\\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless\\r\\nconcealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\r\\nTHE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES—ULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE OF\\r\\nLAERTES—THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA CONCLUDES\\r\\nA PEACE.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he\\r\\nheld the fair golden wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep or wakes them\\r\\njust as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they\\r\\nfollowed whining and gibbering behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow\\r\\nof some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which\\r\\nthey hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of\\r\\nsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\\r\\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the sun and\\r\\nthe land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell the\\r\\nsouls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus,\\r\\nAntilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaans\\r\\nafter the son of Peleus himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon\\r\\njoined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also the ghosts of\\r\\nthose who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus; and the ghost of\\r\\nAchilles spoke first.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Son of Atreus,” it said, “we used to say that Jove had loved you better from\\r\\nfirst to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many and brave\\r\\nmen, when we were all fighting together before Troy; yet the hand of death,\\r\\nwhich no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early. Better for you had\\r\\nyou fallen at Troy in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have\\r\\nbuilt a mound over your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good\\r\\nname, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Happy son of Peleus,” answered the ghost of Agamemnon, “for having died at\\r\\nTroy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell\\r\\nround you fighting for your body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\\r\\nall huge and hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the\\r\\nlivelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane\\r\\nto stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\\r\\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments.\\r\\nThe Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,\\r\\nwhen she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the\\r\\nsound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked\\r\\nfor fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old\\r\\nNestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, ‘Hold, Argives, fly\\r\\nnot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her\\r\\nimmortal nymphs to view the body of her son.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the old man\\r\\nof the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal\\r\\nraiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in\\r\\nlament—calling and answering one another; there was not an Argive but wept for\\r\\npity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned you,\\r\\nmortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and\\r\\nmany a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were\\r\\nburnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\\r\\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with\\r\\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their\\r\\nwork, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and\\r\\nin pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them—gift of\\r\\nBacchus, and work of Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones\\r\\nwith those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also\\r\\nthose of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades\\r\\nnow that Patroclus was no more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out\\r\\nover the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by\\r\\nthose now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother begged\\r\\nprizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of\\r\\nthe Achaeans. You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when\\r\\nthe young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death\\r\\nof some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\\r\\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death your\\r\\nfame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all\\r\\nmankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were\\r\\ndone? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the hands of Aegisthus\\r\\nand those of my wicked wife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts\\r\\nof the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of Agamemnon and\\r\\nAchilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once. The ghost\\r\\nof Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had\\r\\nbeen his host, so it began to talk to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Amphimedon,” it said, “what has happened to all you fine young men—all of an\\r\\nage too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could pick no finer\\r\\nbody of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you\\r\\nwhen you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland\\r\\nwhen you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of\\r\\ntheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you\\r\\nnot remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to\\r\\njoin us with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume\\r\\nour voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, “Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I\\r\\nremember everything that you have said, and will tell you fully and accurately\\r\\nabout the way in which our end was brought about. Ulysses had been long gone,\\r\\nand we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she would not\\r\\nmarry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our\\r\\ndestruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great\\r\\ntambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\\r\\nneedlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\\r\\npress me to marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in\\r\\nneedlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\\r\\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of\\r\\nthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is what she said,\\r\\nand we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day\\r\\nlong, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She\\r\\nfooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time\\r\\nwore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many\\r\\ndays had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told\\r\\nus, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it\\r\\nwhether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after\\r\\nshe had had it washed,[186] its splendour was as that of the\\r\\nsun or moon.\\n---------new doc---------\\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round the\\r\\ntown, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as\\r\\nsoon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter,\\r\\ngroaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses. They took the dead away,\\r\\nburied every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere\\r\\non board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own\\r\\nplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got\\r\\ntogether Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\\r\\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said,\\r\\nweeping bitterly, “My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He\\r\\ntook many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both\\r\\nships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the\\r\\nforemost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get\\r\\naway to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of\\r\\nourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we\\r\\ndo not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should\\r\\nhave no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then,\\r\\nand after them, before they can cross over to the main land.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemius\\r\\nhad now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses. Every one was\\r\\nastonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and\\r\\nMedon said, “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did not do these things against\\r\\nthe will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and\\r\\nstand beside him. This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and\\r\\nnow going furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell\\r\\nthick on one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose\\r\\nto speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future; so\\r\\nhe spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they\\r\\nhave; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the\\r\\nfolly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their\\r\\nhearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the wife of a chieftain who they\\r\\nthought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell\\r\\nyou. Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing\\r\\ndown evil on your own heads.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at once left\\r\\nthe assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of\\r\\nHalitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore\\r\\nhurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met\\r\\ntogether in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He\\r\\nthought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was\\r\\nnever to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me\\r\\nthis question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting still\\r\\nfurther, or will you make peace between them?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own\\r\\narrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? Do\\r\\nwhatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most reasonable\\r\\narrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant,\\r\\nin virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to\\r\\nforgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all\\r\\nbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from\\r\\noff the topmost summits of Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, “Some\\r\\nof you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us.” So one of\\r\\nDolius’s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them\\r\\nall quite near, and said to Ulysses, “Here they are, let us put on our armour\\r\\nat once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could—that is to say Ulysses, his\\r\\nthree men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did the\\r\\nsame—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they had all put\\r\\non their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jove’s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form and voice\\r\\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemachus,\\r\\n“Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show\\r\\nevery man’s mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent\\r\\nfor their strength and courage all the world over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You say truly, my dear father,” answered Telemachus, “and you shall see, if\\r\\nyou will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. “Good heavens,” he exclaimed, “what a\\r\\nday I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying\\r\\nwith one another in the matter of valour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, “Son of Arceisius—-best friend I\\r\\nhave in the world—pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove her father; then\\r\\npoise your spear and hurl it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed to her\\r\\nhe poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went\\r\\nright through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armour rang rattling\\r\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell\\r\\nupon the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears;\\r\\nindeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever\\r\\ngetting home again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one\\r\\npause. “Men of Ithaca,” she cried, “cease this dreadful war, and settle the\\r\\nmatter at once without further bloodshed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms\\r\\ndropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess’\\r\\nvoice, and they fled back to the city for their lives. But Ulysses gave a great\\r\\ncry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the\\r\\nson of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so\\r\\nshe said to Ulysses, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife,\\r\\nor Jove will be angry with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed the\\r\\nform and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace between the\\r\\ntwo contending parties.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]\\r\\n [ Black races are evidently known to the writer as stretching all across\\r\\n Africa, one half looking West on to the Atlantic, and the other East on to the\\r\\n Indian Ocean.]\\n---------new doc---------\\n[61]\\r\\n [ This is hidden malice, implying that the Phaeacian magnates were no better\\r\\n than they should be.

The two Sirens doubtless were, as\\r\\n their name suggests, the whistling gusts, or avalanches of air that at times\\r\\n descend without a moment’s warning from the two lofty mountains of Salinas—as\\r\\n also from all high points in the neighbourhood.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[103]\\r\\n [ See Admiral Smyth on the currents in the Straits of Messina, quoted in “The\\r\\n Authoress of the Odyssey,” p. 197.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[104]\\r\\n [ In the islands of Favognana and Marettimo off Trapani I have seen men fish\\r\\n exactly as here described. They chew bread into a paste and throw it into the\\r\\n sea to attract the fish, which they then spear. No line is used.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[105]\\r\\n [ The writer evidently regards Ulysses as on a coast that looked East at no\\r\\n great distance south of the Straits of Messina somewhere, say, near\\r\\n Tauromenium, now Taormina.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[106]\\r\\n [ Surely there must be a line missing here to tell us that the keel and mast\\r\\n were carried down into Charybdis. Besides, the aorist {Greek} in its present\\r\\n surrounding is perplexing. I have translated it as though it were an\\r\\n imperfect; I see Messrs. Butcher and Lang translate it as a pluperfect, but\\r\\n surely Charybdis was in the act of sucking down the water when Ulysses\\r\\n arrived.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[107]\\r\\n [ I suppose the passage within brackets to have been an afterthought but to\\r\\n have been written by the same hand as the rest of the poem. I suppose xii. 103\\r\\n to have been also added by the writer when she decided on sending Ulysses back\\r\\n to Charybdis. The simile suggests the hand of the wife or daughter of a\\r\\n magistrate who had often seen her father come in cross and tired.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[108]\\r\\n [ Gr.\\r\\n πολυδαίδαλος.\\r\\n This puts coined money out of the question, but nevertheless implies that the\\r\\n gold had been worked into ornaments of some kind.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[109]\\r\\n [ I suppose Teiresias’ prophecy of bk. xi. 114-120 had made no impression on\\r\\n Ulysses. More probably the prophecy was an afterthought, intercalated, as I\\r\\n have already said, by the authoress when she changed her scheme.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[110]\\r\\n [ A male writer would have made Ulysses say, not “may you give satisfaction to\\r\\n your wives,” but “may your wives give satisfaction to you.”]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[111]\\r\\n [ See note [64].]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[112]\\r\\n [ The land was in reality the shallow inlet, now the salt works of S.\\r\\n Cusumano—the neighbourhood of Trapani and Mt. Eryx being made to do double\\r\\n duty, both as Scheria and Ithaca. Hence the necessity for making Ulysses set\\r\\n out after dark, fall instantly into a profound sleep, and wake up on a morning\\r\\n so foggy that he could not see anything till the interviews between Neptune\\r\\n and Jove and between Ulysses and Minerva should have given the audience time\\r\\n to accept the situation. See illustrations and map near the end of bks. v. and\\r\\n vi. respectively.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[113]\\r\\n [ This cave, which is identifiable with singular completeness, is now called\\r\\n the “grotta del toro,” probably a corruption of “tesoro,” for it is held to\\r\\n contain a treasure. See The Authoress of the Odyssey, pp. 167-170.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[114]\\r\\n [ Probably they would.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[115]\\r\\n [ Then it had a shallow shelving bottom.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[116]\\r\\n [ Doubtless the road would pass the harbour in Odyssean times as it passes the\\r\\n salt works now; indeed, if there is to be a road at all there is no other\\r\\n level ground which it could take. See map above referred to.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[117]\\r\\n [ The rock at the end of the Northern harbour of Trapani, to which I suppose\\r\\n the writer of the “Odyssey” to be here referring, still bears the name\\r\\n Malconsiglio—“the rock of evil counsel.” There is a legend that it was a ship\\r\\n of Turkish pirates who were intending to attack Trapani, but the “Madonna di\\r\\n Trapani” crushed them under this rock just as they were coming into port. My\\r\\n friend Cavaliere Giannitrapani of Trapani told me that his father used to tell\\r\\n him when he was a boy that if he would drop exactly three drops of oil on to\\r\\n the water near the rock, he would see the ship still at the bottom. The legend\\r\\n is evidently a Christianised version of the Odyssean story, while the name\\r\\n supplies the additional detail that the disaster happened in consequence of an\\r\\n evil counsel.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[118]\\r\\n [ It would seem then that the ship had got all the way back from Ithaca in\\r\\n about a quarter of an hour.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[119]\\r\\n [ And may we not add “and also to prevent his recognising that he was only in\\r\\n the place where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier.”]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[120]\\r\\n [ All this is to excuse the entire absence of Minerva from books ix.-xii.,\\r\\n which I suppose had been written already, before the authoress had determined\\r\\n on making Minerva so prominent a character.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[121]\\r\\n [ We have met with this somewhat lame attempt to cover the writer’s change of\\r\\n scheme at the end of bk. vi.]\"\n",

BIAGIO INGROIA,\\r\\nPREZIOSO ALLEATO\\r\\nL’AUTORE RICONOSCENTE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\\n\\r\\nThis translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The Authoress of\\r\\nthe Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give the whole “Odyssey”\\r\\nin that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore epitomised my translation,\\r\\nwhich was already completed and which I now publish in full.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\\r\\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I have\\r\\nthere written. The points in question are:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely from, the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike as regards the\\r\\nPhaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of Ulysses, when once he is\\r\\nwithin easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves into a periplus of the island,\\r\\npractically from Trapani back to Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits\\r\\nof Messina, and the island of Pantellaria.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived at the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work under the name\\r\\nof Nausicaa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\\r\\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English and\\r\\nItalian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the “Athenaeum”\\r\\nfor January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were urged (also without\\r\\nrejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle” for the Lent and October terms of the same\\r\\nyear. Nothing to which I should reply has reached me from any quarter, and\\r\\nknowing how anxiously I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in\\r\\nmy argument, I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I\\r\\nshould have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,\\r\\ntherefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce\\r\\nin my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\\r\\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself to\\r\\ntranslating the “Odyssey” for English readers, with such notes as I think will\\r\\nbe found useful. Among these I would especially call attention to one on xxii.\\r\\n465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly allowed me to make public.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of the\\r\\nOdyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court of Ulysses’\\r\\nhouse more vividly before the reader. I should like to explain that the\\r\\npresence of a man and a dog in one illustration is accidental, and was not\\r\\nobserved by me till I developed the negative. In an appendix I have also\\r\\nreprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the plan of Ulysses’ house, together\\r\\nwith the plan itself. The reader is recommended to study this plan with some\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views as to the\\r\\nmain principles by which a translator should be guided, and need not repeat\\r\\nthem here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of translating poetry\\r\\ninto prose involves the continual taking of more or less liberty throughout the\\r\\ntranslation; for much that is right in poetry is wrong in prose, and the\\r\\nexigencies of readable prose are the first things to be considered in a prose\\r\\ntranslation. That the reader, however, may see how far I have departed from\\r\\nstrict construe, I will print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of\\r\\nthe sixty lines or so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAnd Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I\\r\\nam Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here\\r\\nwith my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for\\r\\nTemesa[4] with a\\r\\ncargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over\\r\\nyonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron[5] under the wooded\\r\\nmountain Neritum.[6]\\r\\nOur fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will\\r\\ngo and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives\\r\\nby himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him\\r\\nand get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his\\r\\nvineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came,\\r\\nbut it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\\r\\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or\\r\\na prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\r\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon\\r\\nme from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is\\r\\na man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find\\r\\nsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses\\r\\nreally have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully\\r\\nlike him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail\\r\\nfor Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have\\r\\nnever either of us seen the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a\\r\\nwise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had\\r\\ngrown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more\\r\\nill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope\\r\\nhas such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the\\r\\nmeaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?\\r\\nHave you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family—for no one seems to\\r\\nbe bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests—how atrociously they are\\r\\nbehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any\\r\\nrespectable person who comes near them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father was\\r\\nhere it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure\\r\\nhave willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man\\r\\nwas ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if\\r\\nhe had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him\\r\\nwhen the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built\\r\\na mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but\\r\\nnow the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\r\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but\\r\\ndismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father;\\r\\nheaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all\\r\\nour islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all\\r\\nthe principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of\\r\\npaying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will\\r\\nnot marry,[7] nor yet\\r\\nbring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long\\r\\nwill do so also with myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.\\r\\nGive him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is the man he\\r\\nwas when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would\\r\\nsoon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more\\r\\nupon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to\\r\\nbeg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the\\r\\never-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some,\\r\\nfor he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors\\r\\nwill have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take\\r\\nhis revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about\\r\\ntrying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean\\r\\nheroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your case before them, and call heaven\\r\\nto bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own\\r\\nplace, and if your mother’s mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to\\r\\nher father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage\\r\\ngifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\\r\\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in\\r\\nquest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you\\r\\nsomething, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent\\r\\nmessage may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to\\r\\nSparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you\\r\\nhear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the\\r\\nwaste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other\\r\\nhand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\r\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again.\\r\\nThen, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means\\r\\nor foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\r\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes’ praises\\r\\nfor having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart\\r\\nlooking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now,\\r\\nhowever, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I\\r\\nkeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what\\r\\nI have said to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this\\r\\nway, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you\\r\\nwant to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have\\r\\ntaken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you\\r\\nshall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value—a\\r\\nkeepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As\\r\\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and\\r\\nI will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give\\r\\nyou one of no less value in return.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given\\r\\nTelemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He\\r\\nfelt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so\\r\\nhe went straight to where the suitors were sitting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the\\r\\nsad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the\\r\\nAchaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs,\\r\\nand came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her\\r\\nhandmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts\\r\\nthat supported the roof of the cloisters[8] with a staid maiden on either side of\\r\\nher. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as\\r\\npoets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink\\r\\ntheir wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful\\r\\nheart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and\\r\\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.”[9]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards\\r\\ndo not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and\\r\\nwho sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This\\r\\nfellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people\\r\\nalways applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear\\r\\nit; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another\\r\\nwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for\\r\\nspeech is man’s matter, and mine above all others [10]—for it is I who am master here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were\\r\\nclamorous throughout the covered cloisters[11], and prayed each one that he might be\\r\\nher bed fellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors, let us\\r\\nfeast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing\\r\\nto hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet\\r\\nme in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at\\r\\none another’s houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other\\r\\nhand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove\\r\\nshall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there\\r\\nshall be no man to avenge you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of\\r\\nhis speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The gods seem to have\\r\\ngiven you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be\\r\\nchief in Ithaca as your father was before you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will\\r\\nbe chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no\\r\\nbad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that\\r\\nUlysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some\\r\\nother may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own\\r\\nhouse, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to decide who\\r\\nshall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over\\r\\nyour own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you\\r\\nviolence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this\\r\\nstranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is\\r\\nhis estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he\\r\\non business of his own? He seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so\\r\\nsuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some rumour\\r\\nreaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send\\r\\nfor a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old\\r\\nfriend of my father’s.” But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but\\r\\nwhen night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own\\r\\nabode.[12]\\r\\nTelemachus’s room was high up in a tower[13] that looked on to the outer court;\\r\\nhither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman,\\r\\nEuryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of\\r\\nblazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite\\r\\nyoung; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to\\r\\nher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her\\r\\nto his bed for he feared his wife’s resentment.[14] She it was who now lighted Telemachus\\r\\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house\\r\\ndid, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed\\r\\nroom and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt[15] he gave it to the good old woman, who\\r\\nfolded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\r\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt\\r\\nhome by means of the strap.[16] But Telemachus as he lay covered with\\r\\na woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of\\r\\nthe counsel that Minerva had given him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK II\\n\\r\\nASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE\\r\\nSUITORS—TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH MINERVA\\r\\nDISGUISED AS MENTOR.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once\\r\\nsent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and\\r\\nthe people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the\\r\\nplace of assembly spear in hand—not alone, for his two hounds went with him.\\r\\nMinerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all\\r\\nmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat\\r\\neven the oldest councillors made way for him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more. There is\\r\\nno chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long since counselled\\r\\nhis destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to\\r\\nask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has\\r\\nreigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell\\r\\nme, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that\\r\\nway? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far\\r\\nbetter a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\\r\\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself divined\\r\\nhow it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus\\r\\nstill alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him,\\r\\nnot even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to\\r\\ndogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a\\r\\ndeed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and\\r\\nAegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled\\r\\nAgamemnon’s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a\\r\\ngood natural disposition;[30] moreover there was a bard with her,\\r\\nto whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was\\r\\nto keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction,\\r\\nAegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows\\r\\nand seagulls to batten upon—after which she went willingly enough to the house\\r\\nof Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated\\r\\nmany temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his\\r\\nexpectations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with\\r\\none another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with\\r\\nhis painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus’ ship (and never\\r\\nman knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then\\r\\nand there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press\\r\\nforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\\r\\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far\\r\\nas the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard\\r\\ntill the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\\r\\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the\\r\\nriver Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea\\r\\nfrom a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as\\r\\nPhaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after\\r\\nPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\\r\\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked;\\r\\nbut the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships,\\r\\nthey were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold\\r\\nand substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home\\r\\nplotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled\\r\\nin Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\\r\\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\\r\\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false\\r\\nAegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus\\r\\ncame home,[31] with\\r\\nas much treasure as his ships could carry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home,\\r\\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat\\r\\nup everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand.\\r\\nStill, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has\\r\\nlately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope\\r\\nto get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his\\r\\nreckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and\\r\\nterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and\\r\\ntake your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have\\r\\na chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\\r\\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will\\r\\ntell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, “Sir, all\\r\\nthat you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to\\r\\nbe cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other\\r\\nimmortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early\\r\\nand not keep late hours at a religious festival.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\\r\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\\r\\nwith wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink\\r\\noffering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood\\r\\nup to make their drink offerings. When they had made their offerings and had\\r\\ndrunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on\\r\\nboard their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should leave my\\r\\nhouse to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes,\\r\\nor that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both\\r\\nfor myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and\\r\\ncloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on\\r\\nthe deck of a ship—not while I live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they\\r\\nwill keep open house as I have done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better\\r\\nthat Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with\\r\\nyou and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and\\r\\nkeep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are\\r\\nall young men of Telemachus’ own age, who have taken this voyage out of\\r\\nfriendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I\\r\\nmust go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me.\\r\\nAs for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a\\r\\nchariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him\\r\\nwith your best and fleetest horses.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to the\\r\\nabode of Menelaus[36] [and found him in his own house,\\r\\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also\\r\\nof his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\\r\\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still\\r\\nat Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending\\r\\nher with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’\\r\\nson was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta,[37] the daughter of\\r\\nAlector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\\r\\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as\\r\\ngolden Venus herself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his\\r\\nhouse. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\\r\\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with\\r\\nhis tune.[38]\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon\\r\\nEteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying\\r\\nback into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said,\\r\\n“Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of\\r\\nJove. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find\\r\\nfriends elsewhere as they best can?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never used to\\r\\nbe a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course,\\r\\nand show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have staid often\\r\\nenough at other people’s houses before we got back here, where heaven grant\\r\\nthat we may rest in peace henceforward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They took\\r\\ntheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and\\r\\ngave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against\\r\\nthe end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus were astonished when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of\\r\\nthe sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything to their heart’s\\r\\ncontent, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them\\r\\nwoollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of\\r\\nMenelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and\\r\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a\\r\\nclean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them\\r\\nmany good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them\\r\\nplates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have done\\r\\nsupper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have\\r\\nbeen lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor\\r\\npeople do not have such sons as you are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he handed them[39] a piece of fat roast loin, which had\\r\\nbeen set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\\r\\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\r\\nTelemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might\\r\\nhear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and\\r\\ngold—of amber,[40]\\r\\nivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace\\r\\nof Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove,\\r\\nfor his house and everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men—well,\\r\\nthere may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not; but at\\r\\nall events I have travelled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was\\r\\nnearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus,\\r\\nPhoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and\\r\\nthe Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\\r\\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\\r\\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes\\r\\nyield all the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\\r\\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the\\r\\nperfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all\\r\\nthis wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all\\r\\nthis, and of my heavy loss in the ruin[41] of a stately mansion fully and\\r\\nmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so\\r\\nthat I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain\\r\\nof Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and\\r\\nall of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again,\\r\\nfor crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I\\r\\nmay, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\\r\\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one\\r\\nof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing\\r\\nby it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long\\r\\ntime, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his\\r\\nlong-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him\\r\\nan infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of\\r\\nhis father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he\\r\\nheld his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus saw this he\\r\\ndoubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at\\r\\nonce and find what it was all about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\\r\\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her a seat,\\r\\nAlcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which\\r\\nAlcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which\\r\\nis the richest city in the whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of\\r\\npure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife\\r\\ngave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work\\r\\nbox that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\\r\\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet\\r\\ncoloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her\\r\\nfeet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.[42]\\n---------new doc---------\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she exclaimed,\\r\\n“ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a\\r\\ngoddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So\\r\\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you\\r\\nfurious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in\\r\\nlove with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove\\r\\ncame to hear of it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts.\\r\\nAnd now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor\\r\\ncreature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with\\r\\nlightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\\r\\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and\\r\\ncherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should\\r\\nnever grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels\\r\\nto nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas\\r\\nagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men\\r\\nwho can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good\\r\\nfaith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and punish\\r\\nyou”.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she\\r\\nhad heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes\\r\\never filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired\\r\\nof Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it\\r\\nwas she, not he, that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the\\r\\nrocks and on the sea shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always\\r\\nlooking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out\\r\\nany longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some\\r\\nbeams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may\\r\\ncarry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to\\r\\nsave you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair\\r\\nwind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it—for they know more\\r\\nabout these things, and can settle them better than I can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there is\\r\\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when\\r\\nyou bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well\\r\\nfound ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing\\r\\nthat you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first\\r\\nsolemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a great deal,”\\r\\nsaid she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my\\r\\nwitnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this is the most solemn oath\\r\\nwhich a blessed god can take—that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only\\r\\nadvising you to do exactly what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing\\r\\nwith you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very\\r\\nsorry for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they\\r\\ncame to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury had just left.\\r\\nCalypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her\\r\\nmaids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the\\r\\ngood things that were before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat\\r\\nand drink, Calypso spoke, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own land at\\r\\nonce? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much suffering is\\r\\nin store for you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where\\r\\nyou are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how\\r\\nanxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the\\r\\ntime day after day; yet I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or\\r\\nwell-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman\\r\\nshould compare in beauty with an immortal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am quite\\r\\naware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as\\r\\nyourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I\\r\\nwant to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I\\r\\nam on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had infinite\\r\\ntrouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the\\r\\ninner part of the cave and went to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on his shirt\\r\\nand cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine\\r\\nand graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to\\r\\ncover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on\\r\\nhis way. So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was\\r\\nsharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on\\r\\nto it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\\r\\nthe island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached\\r\\nthe sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water.[53] Then, when she\\r\\nhad shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\\r\\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed\\r\\nthem smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\\r\\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the\\r\\ntimbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\\r\\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the\\r\\nribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and\\r\\na rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\\r\\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and\\r\\nby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too,\\r\\nexcellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the\\r\\nhelp of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should\\r\\nhave his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made\\r\\ntheir drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went\\r\\nhome to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with\\r\\nArete and Alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper.\\r\\nArete was the first to speak, for she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good\\r\\nclothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so\\r\\nshe said, “Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\\r\\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\r\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full\\r\\nthe tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me;\\r\\nbut as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is\\r\\ncalled ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso,\\r\\ndaughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or\\r\\ndivine. Fortune, however, brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for\\r\\nJove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My\\r\\nbrave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was\\r\\ncarried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\r\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the\\r\\ngreat goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost\\r\\nkindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\r\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the\\r\\neighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because\\r\\nJove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind. She sent me\\r\\nfrom her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and\\r\\nwine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew\\r\\nboth warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the\\r\\neighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your\\r\\ncoast—and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still\\r\\nmuch trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no\\r\\nfurther, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that\\r\\nI could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the\\r\\ngale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves\\r\\ndashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came\\r\\nto a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks\\r\\nand it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and\\r\\ngathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so I left the river,\\r\\nand went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and\\r\\npresently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I\\r\\nslept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when\\r\\nI woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing\\r\\nupon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\r\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than\\r\\ncould be expected from so young a person—for young people are apt to be\\r\\nthoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me\\r\\nwashed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now,\\r\\ntherefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring\\r\\nyou on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she was the first\\r\\nperson whose aid you asked.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did tell me\\r\\nto follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you\\r\\nmight perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a\\r\\nlittle suspicious and irritable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry about\\r\\nnothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and\\r\\nApollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I\\r\\ndo, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If\\r\\nyou will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid)\\r\\nshall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I\\r\\nwill attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep[64] during the whole\\r\\nvoyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to\\r\\nyour own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off\\r\\nthan Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired\\r\\nRhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any\\r\\nplace—and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing\\r\\nthemselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\\r\\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that\\r\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable name\\r\\namong mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that\\r\\nwas in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets\\r\\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon\\r\\nwent out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came\\r\\nup to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is\\r\\nready,” and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\r\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\r\\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and\\r\\nUlysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly,\\r\\nwhich was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a\\r\\nseat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous’\\r\\nservants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She\\r\\nwent up to the citizens, man by man, and said, “Aldermen and town councillors\\r\\nof the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger\\r\\nwho has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\\r\\nlike an immortal god.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\\r\\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck\\r\\nwith the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head\\r\\nand shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he\\r\\nmight impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and\\r\\nmight come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge\\r\\nhim. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I\\r\\nmay speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his\\r\\nway to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort\\r\\nand wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we\\r\\nhave done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house\\r\\nhas been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us\\r\\ndraw a ship into the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with\\r\\ntwo and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your\\r\\noars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a\\r\\nfeast.[65] I will\\r\\nfind you in everything. I am giving these instructions to the young men who\\r\\nwill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\\r\\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and\\r\\nwe will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he\\r\\nmay choose to sing about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went\\r\\nto fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they\\r\\nhad been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got\\r\\nher mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\\r\\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They\\r\\nmoored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went\\r\\nto the house of King Alcinous. The out houses,[66] yards, and all the precincts were\\r\\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous\\r\\nkilled them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they\\r\\nskinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly\\r\\nloved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed\\r\\nhim with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous\\r\\nset a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He\\r\\nhung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to\\r\\nfeel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals\\r\\nby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so\\r\\ndisposed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,\\r\\nbut as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired\\r\\nDemodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was\\r\\nthen in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and\\r\\nAchilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat\\r\\ntogether at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains\\r\\nquarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the\\r\\nevil that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\\r\\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was\\r\\nweeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\\r\\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but\\r\\nwhen the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in\\r\\nhis lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.\\r\\nNo one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\\r\\nheard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast,\\r\\nand of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\\r\\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to\\r\\ntell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers,\\r\\njumpers, and runners.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him\\r\\non the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were\\r\\ngoing to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them,\\r\\nand there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos,\\r\\nOcyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus,\\r\\nThoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also\\r\\nEuryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\\r\\nman among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\r\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting\\r\\npost, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the\\r\\nsame moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else\\r\\nbehind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a\\r\\nfallow field.[67]\\r\\nThey then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to\\r\\nbe the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at\\r\\nthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son\\r\\nLaodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had\\r\\nall been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in\\r\\nany of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands,\\r\\nand neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered\\r\\nmuch lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no\\r\\nmatter how strong he is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest and\\r\\nspeak to him about it yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said\\r\\nto Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of\\r\\nour competitions if you are skilled in any of them—and you must have gone in\\r\\nfor many a one before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit\\r\\nall his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet.\\r\\nHave a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your\\r\\nreturn home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the\\r\\nwater, and the crew is found.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set\\r\\nrather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble, and am\\r\\ncome among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me\\r\\non my return home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on a site\\r\\nthat could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild\\r\\nmountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor bewitched creatures whom\\r\\nshe had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not\\r\\nattack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their\\r\\nnoses lovingly against them.[86] As hounds crowd round their master\\r\\nwhen they see him coming from dinner—for they know he will bring them\\r\\nsomething—even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon\\r\\nmy men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.\\r\\nPresently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they stood\\r\\nthere they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\\r\\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours as no one\\r\\nbut a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than\\r\\nany other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working at a loom and\\r\\nsinging most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and\\r\\nsee whether she is woman or goddess.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter.\\r\\nThey, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected\\r\\nmischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them\\r\\nupon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and\\r\\nPramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their\\r\\nhomes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her\\r\\nwand, and shut them up in her pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and\\r\\nall, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as\\r\\nbefore, and they remembered everything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and\\r\\nbeech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the\\r\\nsad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried\\r\\nto speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he\\r\\ncould only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he\\r\\ntold us what had happened to the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of\\r\\nit there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen\\r\\nfrom far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her\\r\\nloom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she\\r\\nat once came down, opened the door, and invited us in. The others did not\\r\\nsuspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I staid where I\\r\\nwas, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them\\r\\nno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\\r\\nfor them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my\\r\\nbow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way. But he laid\\r\\nhold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not force\\r\\nme to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of\\r\\nthem back with you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we\\r\\ncannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save\\r\\nour lives.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the ship, but\\r\\nI must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed\\r\\ngrove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury\\r\\nwith his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and\\r\\nbeauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my\\r\\nhand within his own, saying, ‘My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over\\r\\nthis mountain top, alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in\\r\\nCirce’s pigstyes, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\\r\\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back\\r\\nand will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will\\r\\nprotect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of\\r\\ngreat virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe’s house, it will be a\\r\\ntalisman to you against every kind of mischief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to\\r\\npractice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will drug the\\r\\nmeal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the\\r\\nvirtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working.\\r\\nI will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your\\r\\nsword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her. She will then\\r\\nbe frightened, and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not\\r\\npoint blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to\\r\\ntake good care also of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all\\r\\nthe blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else\\r\\nwhen she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it was\\r\\nlike. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call\\r\\nit Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they\\r\\nlike.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I\\r\\nfared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I\\r\\nwalked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and\\r\\nas soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come\\r\\nin; so I followed her—much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly\\r\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet,\\r\\nand she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it,\\r\\nfor she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without\\r\\nits charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off\\r\\nto the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon\\r\\nshe fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying,\\r\\n‘Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you come? How can it\\r\\nbe that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man able to\\r\\nstand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be spell-proof;\\r\\nsurely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always\\r\\nsaid would come here some day with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so\\r\\nbe it then; sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends\\r\\nand learn to trust each other.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Mother,’ said I, ‘I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean land nor set\\r\\nfoot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of\\r\\nmisfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilius,\\r\\nthe land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nin what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe\\r\\nyou a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the\\r\\nson whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one\\r\\nelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me\\r\\nagain what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with\\r\\nmy son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could\\r\\nand married again?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in\\r\\ngreat distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day.\\r\\nNo one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still\\r\\nholds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of course he\\r\\nmust, considering his position as a magistrate,[92] and how every one invites him; your\\r\\nfather remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the town. He\\r\\nhas no comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\\r\\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\\r\\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\\r\\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never\\r\\nhaving come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own\\r\\nend it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my\\r\\nown house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear\\r\\npeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the\\r\\nforce of my affection for you—this it was that was the death of me.’[93]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost. Thrice I\\r\\nsprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time she flitted\\r\\nfrom my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick I\\r\\nsaid to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we\\r\\ncould throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the\\r\\nsharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay\\r\\na still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine\\r\\nthat is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are dead. The\\r\\nsinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the\\r\\nfierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul\\r\\nflits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day\\r\\nas soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your\\r\\nwife hereafter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and\\r\\ndaughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood,\\r\\nand I considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nit would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep\\r\\nthem from all drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other,\\r\\nand each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus\\r\\nthe son of Aeolus.[94] She fell in love with the river\\r\\nEnipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\\r\\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay\\r\\nwith her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched itself like a\\r\\nmountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin\\r\\ngirdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed\\r\\nof love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will;\\r\\nthe embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about\\r\\nthis time twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home,\\r\\nbut hold your tongue and do not tell any one.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who\\r\\nboth of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of\\r\\nsheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. The rest of her\\r\\nchildren were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a\\r\\nmighty warrior and charioteer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of having slept\\r\\nin the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethus.\\r\\nThese founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it; for\\r\\nstrong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable\\r\\nHercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon, and married the\\r\\nredoubtable son of Amphitryon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it was to\\r\\nmarry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after having killed his\\r\\nfather, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he\\r\\nremained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him;\\r\\nbut Epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged\\r\\nherself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged\\r\\nmother—to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given priceless\\r\\npresents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of\\r\\nMinyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore Nestor, Chromius, and\\r\\nPericlymenus, and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was\\r\\nwooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who\\r\\nshould raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and\\r\\nthis was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a\\r\\ncertain excellent seer,[95] but the will of heaven was against\\r\\nhim, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;\\r\\nnevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season came round again,\\r\\nIphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\\r\\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor\\r\\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying\\r\\nunder the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of\\r\\nJove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day\\r\\nthroughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles,\\r\\ntook away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she\\r\\nbleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes\\r\\nand threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer\\r\\ngarment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a\\r\\ntwisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went\\r\\nstraight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\r\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded\\r\\ncountry and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where\\r\\nMinerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty\\r\\nservant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the\\r\\nyards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made\\r\\nthem spacious[126] and fair to see, with a free run\\r\\nfor the pigs all round them; he had built them during his master’s absence, of\\r\\nstones which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to\\r\\nPenelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside\\r\\nthe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close\\r\\ntogether, while inside he had built twelve styes near one another for the sows\\r\\nto lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding\\r\\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the\\r\\nsuitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had\\r\\ncontinually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman’s\\r\\nfour hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The\\r\\nswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals[127] from a good\\r\\nstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or\\r\\nanother, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced\\r\\nto send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but\\r\\nUlysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he\\r\\nhad in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead\\r\\nhad not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate\\r\\nof the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them.\\r\\nThen he said to Ulysses, “Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work\\r\\nof you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me\\r\\nquite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am\\r\\nin continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to\\r\\neat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some\\r\\ndistant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and\\r\\nwine, tell me where you come from, and all about your misfortunes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He\\r\\nstrewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he\\r\\nthrew the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he used to sleep by\\r\\nnight. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said “May Jove, sir,\\r\\nand the rest of the gods grant you your heart’s desire in return for the kind\\r\\nway in which you have received me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still poorer man\\r\\nshould come here, it would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers\\r\\nand beggars are from Jove. You must take what you can get and be thankful, for\\r\\nservants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is\\r\\nmy misfortune now, for heaven has hindered the return of him who would have\\r\\nbeen always good to me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of\\r\\nland, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\\r\\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they\\r\\nhave mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he\\r\\nwould have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen’s\\r\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good\\r\\nman. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds,\\r\\nto fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where the young\\r\\nsucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and\\r\\nsacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted them; when the meat was\\r\\ncooked he brought it all in and set it before Ulysses, hot and still on the\\r\\nspit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd\\r\\nthen mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told\\r\\nhim to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat pigs have\\r\\nto go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed\\r\\ngods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is lawful and\\r\\nright. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and\\r\\nJove gives them their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and\\r\\ngot home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but\\r\\nsome god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\r\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\r\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear or\\r\\nstint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one\\r\\nvictim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly\\r\\nrich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he\\r\\nwas; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.\\r\\nThere are twelve herds of cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of\\r\\nsheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired\\r\\nstrangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he\\r\\nruns even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in\\r\\nthe charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the\\r\\nbest goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs\\r\\nthat you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending\\r\\nit to them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously without\\r\\na word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the\\r\\nswineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and\\r\\ngave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, “My\\r\\nfriend, who was this master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich\\r\\nand so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King\\r\\nAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove\\r\\nand the other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have\\r\\ntravelled much.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war\\r\\ncry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen\\r\\nand foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my\\r\\nmen, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves\\r\\nsurrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do\\r\\nforced labour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I wish\\r\\nI had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store\\r\\nfor me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\r\\nI went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them,\\r\\nwhereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to\\r\\nhis own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kill me in\\r\\ntheir fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the\\r\\nprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\r\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on for\\r\\neight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already\\r\\ncommitted all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with\\r\\nhim to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months and days had gone\\r\\nby till the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\\r\\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that\\r\\nplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I\\r\\nfetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not\\r\\nhelp it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies\\r\\nbetween Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their destruction, for\\r\\nas soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky,\\r\\nhe raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then\\r\\nJove let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was\\r\\nfilled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all\\r\\ninto the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like\\r\\nso many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\r\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s mast within my\\r\\nreach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of\\r\\nthe gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great\\r\\nwave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the\\r\\nThesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all—for\\r\\nhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he\\r\\nraised me by the hand, took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to\\r\\nwear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had\\r\\nentertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward\\r\\njourney. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so\\r\\nmuch had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had\\r\\ngone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the god’s high oak tree,\\r\\nand know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or\\r\\nin secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in\\r\\nhis own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew\\r\\nfound, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\r\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be\\r\\nsure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very\\r\\nextreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land they\\r\\nresolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that\\r\\nI was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see\\r\\nme; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there\\r\\nthey bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to\\r\\nget supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\\r\\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck\\r\\nout and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\r\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went\\r\\nsearching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and\\r\\nwent back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me\\r\\nto a good man’s door—for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I have found\\r\\nthe story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that part about\\r\\nUlysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. Why should a man\\r\\nlike you go about telling lies in this way? I know all about the return of my\\r\\nmaster. The gods one and all of them detest him, or they would have taken him\\r\\nbefore Troy, or let him die with friends around him when the days of his\\r\\nfighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\r\\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds\\r\\nhave spirited him away we know not whither.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town\\r\\nunless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about Ulysses.\\r\\nThen they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the\\r\\nking’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it. For my own part I have never cared about asking\\r\\nanyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a\\r\\nman and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind\\r\\nto him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting\\r\\nhis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the\\r\\nfollowing summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much\\r\\nwealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\r\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any\\r\\nsuch reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the\\r\\ngod of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you\\r\\nmy oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call\\r\\nall the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a\\r\\ncloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but\\r\\nif he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and tell them to\\r\\nthrow me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the\\r\\ncountry telling lies.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and\\r\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing\\r\\nyou hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but\\r\\nit is just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may\\r\\ncook something savoury for supper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs,\\r\\nwhich were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a tremendous\\r\\nsquealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus called to\\r\\nhis men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice him for\\r\\nthis stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble\\r\\nenough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five\\r\\nyear old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not forget the gods,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut\\r\\nbristles from the pig’s face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the\\r\\ngods as he did so that Ulysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig\\r\\nwith a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,\\r\\nand stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it\\r\\nup, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the\\r\\nfat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut\\r\\nthe rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\r\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on\\r\\nto the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then\\r\\nstood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he\\r\\nset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did\\r\\nso; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices\\r\\ncut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much\\r\\npleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well disposed\\r\\ntowards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like\\r\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your\\r\\nsupper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks\\r\\nright, for he can do whatever he chooses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to\\r\\nthe immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands\\r\\nof Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius brought them their\\r\\nbread; the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the\\r\\nTaphians during his master’s absence, and had paid for him with his own money\\r\\nwithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their\\r\\nhands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough\\r\\nto eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all\\r\\nwent to bed after having made a hearty supper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured\\r\\nwithout ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet\\r\\nquarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the excellent care\\r\\nhe took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of\\r\\nhis men give him one. “Listen to me,” said he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you;\\r\\nwhen I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes\\r\\nme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will\\r\\nmake him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\\r\\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young\\r\\nand strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses\\r\\nwere the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it\\r\\nso. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our\\r\\narmour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\r\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell\\r\\nsmall and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\\r\\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with\\r\\ntheir shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind\\r\\nme, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my\\r\\nshirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had\\r\\nshifted their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and\\r\\nhe at once gave me his ear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak;\\r\\nsome god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, and I do not\\r\\nknow what to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following plan:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’ Then he\\r\\nraised his head on his elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a\\r\\nlong way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell Agamemnon to\\r\\nsend us up more men at once.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the\\r\\nships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning.\\r\\nWould that I were still young and strong as I was in those days, for then some\\r\\none of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the\\r\\nrespect due to a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my\\r\\nclothes are shabby.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story, and have\\r\\nsaid nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore,\\r\\nyou shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress\\r\\nmay reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old\\r\\nrags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up\\r\\nhere, but every man has only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will\\r\\ngive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins and\\r\\nsheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay down, and\\r\\nEumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in\\r\\ncase of extraordinarily bad weather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd\\r\\ndid not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go outside, and\\r\\nUlysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master’s\\r\\nabsence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick\\r\\ncloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a large and well fed goat,\\r\\nand a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his\\r\\nrest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them\\r\\nshelter from the North wind.\\n---------new doc---------\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\\r\\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as he did\\r\\nso. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the house, and they\\r\\nboth of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a\\r\\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\r\\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them\\r\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\\r\\nEteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes\\r\\npoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\r\\nbefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove\\r\\nout through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\\r\\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in\\r\\nfront of the horses and pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see\\r\\nthat you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any\\r\\nfather could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as soon as\\r\\nwe see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned when I get\\r\\nback to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have shown\\r\\nme and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a great\\r\\nwhite goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard—and all\\r\\nthe men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up to\\r\\nthem and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw\\r\\nit they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon\\r\\nPisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but\\r\\nHelen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this matter as heaven has\\r\\nput it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle\\r\\ncame from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner\\r\\nUlysses, after having travelled far and suffered much, will return to take his\\r\\nrevenge—if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the\\r\\nsuitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be so, I\\r\\nwill make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the\\r\\ntown towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and\\r\\ntravelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus,\\r\\nthe son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated hospitably.\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their\\r\\nhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner\\r\\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus\\r\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\\r\\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You\\r\\nknow our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age,\\r\\nand this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not, therefore,\\r\\ntake me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father’s house he\\r\\nwill try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go\\r\\nhome at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed\\r\\nit best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s beautiful\\r\\npresents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said, “Go on\\r\\nboard at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell\\r\\nmy father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he\\r\\nwill come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he\\r\\nwill be very angry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon\\r\\nreached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave his orders.\\r\\n“Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on board the ship, and let us\\r\\nset out home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\\r\\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in the\\r\\nship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was\\r\\nflying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus,\\r\\nwho used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great\\r\\nhouse, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus.\\r\\nNeleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a\\r\\nclose prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both\\r\\non account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great\\r\\nsorrow that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped\\r\\nwith his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that\\r\\nhad been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left\\r\\nthe country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over\\r\\nmuch people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons\\r\\nAntiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of\\r\\nAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not\\r\\nlive to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His\\r\\nsons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was\\r\\nfather to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\\r\\nfor his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made\\r\\nPolypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.\\r\\nHe quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained\\r\\nand prophesied for all men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making\\r\\ndrink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now that I find\\r\\nyou sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and\\r\\nby the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those\\r\\nof your followers tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence\\r\\nare you? Tell me also of your town and parents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my\\r\\nfather is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some\\r\\nmiserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see\\r\\nif I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia,[134] where the land\\r\\nbegins to turn round and look in another direction.[135] It is not very thickly peopled, but\\r\\nthe soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds\\r\\nwith wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by\\r\\nany sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\\r\\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is\\r\\ndivided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable\\r\\nto the gods, reigned over both.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the\\r\\nPhoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with gewgaws\\r\\nof all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father’s house,\\r\\nvery tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of\\r\\nher one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her\\r\\nin ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The\\r\\nman who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\\r\\nthis she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am\\r\\ndaughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the\\r\\ntown from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the\\r\\nsea, where they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their\\r\\nprice for me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along with us\\r\\nto see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? They are both\\r\\nalive and are said to be well off.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a solemn\\r\\noath that you will do me no harm by the way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath the\\r\\nwoman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the\\r\\nwell, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and tell my\\r\\nmaster, in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison,\\r\\nand would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your\\r\\nmerchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I\\r\\nwill bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else\\r\\nalso that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\\r\\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry\\r\\nhim off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you\\r\\ntake him and sell him in foreign parts.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till\\r\\nthey had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they\\r\\nhad got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very\\r\\ncunning fellow, came to my father’s house bringing a necklace of gold with\\r\\namber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in\\r\\ntheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the\\r\\nwoman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\\r\\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\\r\\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance\\r\\non him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she\\r\\nsnatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I\\r\\nfollowed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over\\r\\nall the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\\r\\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed\\r\\ntheir ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind;\\r\\nsix days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck\\r\\nthe woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were a\\r\\nsea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and\\r\\nfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves\\r\\ntook the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and\\r\\nthus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the\\r\\nmost lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as well as evil, for\\r\\nin spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you always have\\r\\nenough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going\\r\\nabout begging my way from city to city.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep,\\r\\nfor it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his crew were nearing\\r\\nland, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the\\r\\nharbour.[136]\\r\\nThey cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out\\r\\nupon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had\\r\\nhad enough to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but\\r\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the\\r\\nevening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and\\r\\nto-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner\\r\\nwith meat and wine.” [137]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To\\r\\nwhose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I go straight\\r\\nto your own house and to your mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go to my own\\r\\nhouse, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment,\\r\\nhowever, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my mother\\r\\nwill not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits\\r\\nat her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a\\r\\nman whose house you can go to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held\\r\\nin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and\\r\\nthe most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\\r\\ntrying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows whether or\\r\\nno they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s\\r\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them\\r\\noff,[138] fell to\\r\\nthe ground midway between Telemachus and the ship. On this Theoclymenus called\\r\\nhim apart and caught him by the hand. “Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not\\r\\nfly on your right hand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I\\r\\nsaw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that\\r\\nthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show you so\\r\\nmuch good will and give you so many presents that all who meet you will\\r\\ncongratulate you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say.\\r\\nTwenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhither; but\\r\\nI will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple\\r\\nwool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for\\r\\nthe pin. On the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a\\r\\nspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the\\r\\nground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in\\r\\ngold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was\\r\\nstruggling convulsively to escape.[153] As for the shirt that he wore next\\r\\nhis skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\r\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it.\\r\\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether\\r\\nUlysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions\\r\\nhad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose\\r\\nhouse he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\\r\\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of\\r\\nbronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down\\r\\nto his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had\\r\\na servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\r\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched,[154] he was dark, and he had thick curly\\r\\nhair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity\\r\\nthan he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that\\r\\nUlysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said\\r\\nto him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall\\r\\nbe honoured and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes\\r\\nyou speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and\\r\\nI gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\\r\\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\\r\\ndetested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\\r\\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you\\r\\nfor doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would\\r\\nnaturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than\\r\\nUlysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to\\r\\nwhat I can tell you. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect\\r\\ntruth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home;\\r\\nhe is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that\\r\\nhe has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were\\r\\nlost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were\\r\\nangry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they\\r\\nwere all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was\\r\\ndrifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals,\\r\\nand who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and\\r\\nwishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\r\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\\r\\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare\\r\\nwith him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to\\r\\nme—making drink-offerings in his house as he did so—that the ship was by the\\r\\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He\\r\\nsent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\r\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\\r\\nthat he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after\\r\\nso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may\\r\\nknow he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain\\r\\naway from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath,\\r\\nand call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also\\r\\nthat hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall\\r\\nsurely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\\r\\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you shall have\\r\\nsuch gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate\\r\\nyou; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will not return, neither will\\r\\nyou get your escort hence, for so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are\\r\\nnow no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to receive honourable\\r\\nstrangers or to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his\\r\\nfeet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\\r\\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him\\r\\nagain, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\r\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him;\\r\\nlike it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall\\r\\nyou be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in\\r\\ngoodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid\\r\\nand ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal\\r\\nhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak\\r\\ncontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals\\r\\nrighteously, the people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\\r\\nhim blessed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that\\r\\nI left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain\\r\\non many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any\\r\\nrough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my\\r\\nfeet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my\\r\\nfeet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\\r\\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my\\r\\nhouse there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety\\r\\nas you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman—the\\r\\nsame who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and\\r\\nnursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.”\\r\\n“Come here,” said she, “Euryclea, and wash your master’s age-mate; I suppose\\r\\nUlysses’ hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages\\r\\nall of us dreadfully fast.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed\\r\\nabout as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire,\\r\\ndoing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as\\r\\nsoon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking\\r\\nall the time how, single handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large\\r\\na body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from\\r\\nheaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor\\r\\nunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is\\r\\nsafe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father\\r\\nmay be proud of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am in some\\r\\ndoubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed,\\r\\nseeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further\\r\\ndifficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Jove’s and\\r\\nyour assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I\\r\\nam to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse ally than\\r\\nmyself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I\\r\\nnot a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles? I\\r\\ntell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us\\r\\nand eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive\\r\\nthem away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all\\r\\nnight, and you shall be out of your troubles before long.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed\\r\\nbegan to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Diana\\r\\nsaying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart\\r\\nand slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of\\r\\ndarkness till it drop me into the mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the\\r\\ndaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and\\r\\nmother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took\\r\\ncare of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them\\r\\nto excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an\\r\\nimposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\\r\\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them\\r\\nmarried (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to\\r\\nevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to\\r\\nthe dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide\\r\\nme from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go\\r\\neven beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only,\\r\\nand without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no\\r\\nmatter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as\\r\\nthey can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget\\r\\ngood and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\\r\\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was\\r\\nwhen he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no\\r\\ndream, but the very truth itself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it\\r\\npuzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side.\\r\\nThen he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set\\r\\nthem on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s hide out into the\\r\\nopen. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying “Father Jove, since\\r\\nyou have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the\\r\\nafflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\\r\\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another\\r\\nsign of some kind from outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among\\r\\nthe clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard\\r\\nit. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill\\r\\nroom lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve\\r\\nmiller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the\\r\\nstaff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take their\\r\\nrest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they\\r\\nwere, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to\\r\\nher master. “Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you\\r\\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this\\r\\nmeans something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant\\r\\nwho calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in\\r\\nthe house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\\r\\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s speech,\\r\\nand by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the\\r\\nsuitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\r\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about his\\r\\nshoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a doughty spear\\r\\nwith a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister\\r\\nand said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as\\r\\nregards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?—for my mother,\\r\\ngood woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate\\r\\npeople, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find fault\\r\\nwith. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did\\r\\nask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he\\r\\nwanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he\\r\\nwas such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under\\r\\nblankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins\\r\\nput for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”[157]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were\\r\\nmeeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for\\r\\nhis two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and said, “Come, wake\\r\\nup; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the\\r\\ndust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a\\r\\nwet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water from the\\r\\nfountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\\r\\nfor it is a feast day.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to\\r\\nthe fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the\\r\\nhouse. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began\\r\\nchopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the\\r\\nswineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he\\r\\nlet feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\\r\\n“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent\\r\\nas ever?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with which they\\r\\ndeal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense of shame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too\\r\\nwas bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two\\r\\nshepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\\r\\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here, stranger,” said he,\\r\\n“to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You\\r\\nand I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a\\r\\ntaste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts\\r\\nelsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man,\\r\\nPhiloetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats.\\r\\nThese were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when\\r\\nany one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under\\r\\nthe gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he,\\r\\n“is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his\\r\\nfamily? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\\r\\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so\\r\\npleases them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand; “Good\\r\\nday to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very poorly off now, but\\r\\nI hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove, of all gods you are\\r\\nthe most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all\\r\\nour misery and afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my\\r\\neyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about\\r\\nin just such rags as this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If\\r\\nhe is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\\r\\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and\\r\\nnow his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\\r\\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\\r\\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though he is in\\r\\nthe house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide\\r\\nUlysses’ property among them because he has been away so long. I have often\\r\\nthought—only it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with\\r\\nthe cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\\r\\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My position is\\r\\nintolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the\\r\\nprotection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet\\r\\nreturn, and send all these suitors flying out of the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and\\r\\nI can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will\\r\\nconfirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that\\r\\nhearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave\\r\\nthis place, and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who\\r\\nare now masters here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should see how\\r\\nI would do my very utmost to help him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder\\r\\nTelemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an eagle with a dove\\r\\nin its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends, this plot of ours to\\r\\nmurder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches\\r\\nand seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the\\r\\ninward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine in the\\r\\nmixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed\\r\\nround the bread in the bread baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their\\r\\nwine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was\\r\\npaved with stone;[158] he gave him a shabby looking seat\\r\\nat a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\r\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your wine\\r\\namong the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the\\r\\nsuitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed\\r\\nfrom him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to\\r\\nyourselves, or there will be mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then\\r\\nAntinous said, “We do not like such language but we will put up with it, for\\r\\nTelemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had let us we should have\\r\\nput a stop to his brave talk ere now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were\\r\\nbringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under\\r\\nthe shady grove of Apollo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his\\r\\nportion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at table gave\\r\\nUlysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told\\r\\nthem to do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for\\r\\nshe wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now there happened\\r\\nto be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from\\r\\nSame. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of\\r\\nUlysses, and said to the suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has\\r\\nalready had as large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not\\r\\nright nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\\r\\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have something\\r\\nto give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses’ servants.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their skill with\\r\\nthe bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of\\r\\nbringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store-room key,\\r\\nwhich was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her\\r\\nmaidens into the store-room at the end of the house, where her husband’s\\r\\ntreasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his\\r\\nbow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend\\r\\nwhom he had met in Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with\\r\\none another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\r\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\r\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away\\r\\nwith them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long\\r\\njourney while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent\\r\\nhim on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get\\r\\nback twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running\\r\\nwith them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to\\r\\nthe house of Jove’s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of\\r\\nvalour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he\\r\\nfeared not heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\\r\\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\r\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the\\r\\nbow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had\\r\\nbeen left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear,\\r\\nand this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at\\r\\none another’s houses, for Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do\\r\\nso. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by\\r\\nUlysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home,\\r\\nbut had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the carpenter\\r\\nhad planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite\\r\\nstraight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed\\r\\nthe strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight\\r\\nhome to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;[161] these flew open with a noise like a\\r\\nbull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform,\\r\\nwhere the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along\\r\\nwith fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case\\r\\nfrom the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping\\r\\nbitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved\\r\\nher, she went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the\\r\\nquiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came\\r\\nher maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her\\r\\nhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of\\r\\nthe bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before\\r\\nher face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house\\r\\nbecause its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you\\r\\nwant to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I\\r\\nwill bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it\\r\\nmost easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I\\r\\nfollow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in\\r\\nwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the\\r\\nsuitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by,\\r\\nthe stockman wept also when he saw his master’s bow, but Antinous scolded them.\\r\\n“You country louts,” said he, “silly simpletons; why should you add to the\\r\\nsorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in\\r\\nthe loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence,\\r\\nor go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\\r\\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light\\r\\nmatter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\r\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was\\r\\nthen only a child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string\\r\\nthe bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that\\r\\nshould taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring\\r\\nin his own house—egging the others on to do so also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have robbed me\\r\\nof my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this\\r\\nhouse and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there\\r\\nwere nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let\\r\\nit go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos,\\r\\nor Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I\\r\\ndo; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\\r\\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too\\r\\nwill make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I\\r\\nshall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win\\r\\nthe prizes which my father won before me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took\\r\\nhis sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove\\r\\nwhich he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.[162] Then he\\r\\nstamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw\\r\\nhim set them up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind\\r\\nbefore. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice\\r\\ndid he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he\\r\\nhad to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the\\r\\niron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not\\r\\nUlysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young,\\r\\nand have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if\\r\\nany one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial\\r\\nof the bow and get this contest settled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into\\r\\nthe house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down\\r\\non the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at\\r\\nwhich the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He was\\r\\nsacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl.\\r\\n[163] He was the\\r\\nonly man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others. He was\\r\\nnow the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make\\r\\nhis trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused\\r\\nto hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My\\r\\nfriends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life\\r\\nand soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\r\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has\\r\\nbrought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that\\r\\nhe may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo\\r\\nand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\\r\\nmakes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,[164] with the arrow\\r\\nstanding against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat\\r\\nfrom which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable;\\r\\nit makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many\\r\\na chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were\\r\\nnot born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in the\\r\\ncourt, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large\\r\\nball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease\\r\\nit—we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He\\r\\nalso brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the\\r\\nsuitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them\\r\\nnearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous\\r\\nand Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the\\r\\nforemost among them all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses\\r\\nsaid to them quietly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt\\r\\nwhether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you\\r\\nbe to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?\\r\\nSay which you are disposed to do—to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so ordain\\r\\nit. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might\\r\\nand main I would fight for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when,\\r\\ntherefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said, “It is I,\\r\\nUlysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year,\\r\\nI am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants\\r\\nare glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying\\r\\nfor my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be.\\r\\nIf heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\\r\\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\r\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you\\r\\nconvincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar\\r\\nfrom the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mt. Parnassus\\r\\nwith the sons of Autolycus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had\\r\\nexamined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms\\r\\nround him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands\\r\\nand faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if\\r\\nUlysses had not checked them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell\\r\\nthose who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I\\r\\nwill go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this moreover be the token\\r\\nbetween us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of\\r\\nthe bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you\\r\\nare carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their\\r\\napartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at\\r\\ntheir work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and to bind them securely at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he\\r\\nhad left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by\\r\\nthe fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He\\r\\nheaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve that\\r\\nI shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about\\r\\nthis, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel\\r\\nmost is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot\\r\\nstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it yourself.\\r\\nToday is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on\\r\\nsuch a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes they can stay where they\\r\\nare, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the\\r\\ncupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop\\r\\nthis matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats\\r\\ntomorrow—the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\\r\\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the\\r\\nhands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water\\r\\nand handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they\\r\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses\\r\\ncraftily said:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded.\\r\\nI appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken\\r\\nwith so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the\\r\\ngods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the\\r\\nmoment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among\\r\\nyou all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or\\r\\nwhether travel and neglect have made an end of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\r\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you have\\r\\nnot so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself\\r\\nlucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any\\r\\nsmaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to\\r\\nhear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear\\r\\nwhat we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as\\r\\nit does with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the\\r\\nCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When\\r\\nthe wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\\r\\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed\\r\\nat him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the\\r\\ndoorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his\\r\\ncrime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between\\r\\nmankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own\\r\\ndrunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if\\r\\nyou string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at\\r\\nonce ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you\\r\\nwill never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a\\r\\nquarrel with men younger than yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that you\\r\\nshould ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. If the\\r\\nstranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can\\r\\nyou suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the\\r\\nman himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that\\r\\ndisturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man will\\r\\ntake you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the\\r\\nbaser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say,\\r\\n‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave\\r\\nman whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who\\r\\ncame to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This\\r\\nis what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the estate of\\r\\na great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think\\r\\nwell of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This\\r\\nstranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth.\\r\\nGive him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\\r\\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and\\r\\nrobbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\r\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the\\r\\nislands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the\\r\\nbow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even\\r\\nthough I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him\\r\\ntake it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This\\r\\nbow is a man’s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the\\r\\nsuitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said,\\r\\n“You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If\\r\\nApollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get\\r\\nyou into some quiet little place, and worry you to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down\\r\\nthen and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the\\r\\ncloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in\\r\\nspite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the\\r\\ncountry, for I am the better man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than\\r\\nall the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of\\r\\nthem off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a\\r\\nbetter humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in\\r\\nthe hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea apart and said\\r\\nto her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women’s\\r\\napartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are\\r\\nat their work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s apartments.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer\\r\\ncourt. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he\\r\\nmade the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he\\r\\nhad left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands,\\r\\nand was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the\\r\\nworms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one\\r\\nturn towards his neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\\r\\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\r\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is\\r\\nlikely to be in stringing this bow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as\\r\\neasily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted\\r\\ngut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string,\\r\\nand it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The\\r\\nsuitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment,\\r\\nmoreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as\\r\\nhe heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\\r\\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage\\r\\nto Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our\\r\\ndestruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the\\r\\nswineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were\\r\\nsome miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him,\\r\\nnot even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him.\\r\\nHe endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\\r\\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and\\r\\nTelemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\\r\\nbehind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of\\r\\niron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of\\r\\nour end, for not one of us could string the bow—nor nearly do so. When it was\\r\\nabout to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should\\r\\nnot be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his\\r\\nhaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his\\r\\narrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured\\r\\nhis arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous,\\r\\nand then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\\r\\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them,\\r\\nfor they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there\\r\\nwas a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the\\r\\nground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and\\r\\nour bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends\\r\\nat home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and\\r\\nwash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\\r\\noffices due to the departed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you are\\r\\nindeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of\\r\\nunderstanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of\\r\\nIcarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals\\r\\nshall compose a song that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the\\r\\nconstancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of\\r\\nTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\\r\\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the\\r\\nearth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town and soon reached\\r\\nthe fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with infinite\\r\\nlabour. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the\\r\\nslaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there\\r\\nwas an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When\\r\\nUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile\\r\\nI want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognise me after so\\r\\nlong an absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went\\r\\nstraight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial\\r\\nof his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolius,\\r\\nnor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering\\r\\nthorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had\\r\\ntold them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a\\r\\ndirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs\\r\\nof oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather;\\r\\nhe had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When\\r\\nUlysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall\\r\\npear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and\\r\\ntell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question\\r\\nhim and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with\\r\\nhim, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging\\r\\nabout a plant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener—what pains you\\r\\ntake with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine,\\r\\nolive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust,\\r\\nhowever, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of\\r\\nyour garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It\\r\\ncannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,\\r\\nindeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\\r\\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should\\r\\nwash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but\\r\\ntell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\\r\\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have come to\\r\\nreally Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and\\r\\nhad not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old\\r\\nfriend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\\r\\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once\\r\\nwhen I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I\\r\\nliked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was\\r\\nLaertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all\\r\\nthe abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\\r\\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with\\r\\nflowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of\\r\\ntapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve\\r\\nfair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good\\r\\nlooking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nHis father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the country\\r\\nthat you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked people. All this\\r\\nwealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have found your\\r\\nfriend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would\\r\\nhave requited your presents amply when you left him—as would have been only\\r\\nright considering what you had already given him. But tell me, and tell me\\r\\ntrue, how many years is it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as\\r\\never was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea\\r\\nhave eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\\r\\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could\\r\\nthrow our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent\\r\\nand richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his\\r\\ndeath bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But\\r\\nnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you—tell me of your\\r\\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to\\r\\nIthaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought\\r\\nyou here have gone on their way and left you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come from\\r\\nAlybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who is the son of\\r\\nPolypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I was\\r\\nleaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my will. As for my ship\\r\\nit is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the\\r\\nfifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good\\r\\nfor him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and\\r\\nI rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have\\r\\nanother friendly meeting and exchange presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands\\r\\nwith the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey head, groaning\\r\\nheavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils\\r\\nquivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his\\r\\narms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he, father, about whom you are\\r\\nasking—I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But cease your\\r\\nsighing and lamentation—we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I\\r\\nhave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence\\r\\nand crimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come back again,\\r\\nyou must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall convince me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s tusk\\r\\nwhen I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to\\r\\nAutolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he was over\\r\\nhere he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees\\r\\nin the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed\\r\\nyou round the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and\\r\\nwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\\r\\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn\\r\\nplanted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of\\r\\nheaven has been laid heavy upon them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son\\r\\nhad given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or\\r\\nhe would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and was\\r\\nbeginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father Jove, then you gods are\\r\\nstill in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their\\r\\ninsolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the\\r\\ntownspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers\\r\\neverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let\\r\\nus go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told Telemachus,\\r\\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as\\r\\npossible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there\\r\\nthey found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and\\r\\nmixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed\\r\\nhim and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up\\r\\nto him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter\\r\\nthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\\r\\nan immortal, and said to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been\\r\\nmaking you much taller and better-looking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the\\r\\nman I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took Nericum, that strong\\r\\nfortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had been in our\\r\\nhouse yesterday with my armour on, I should have been able to stand by you and\\r\\nhelp you against the suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and\\r\\nyou would have rejoiced to see it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and\\r\\nthe feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper place on the\\r\\nbenches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolius and his sons\\r\\nleft their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after\\r\\nLaertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw\\r\\nUlysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but\\r\\nUlysses scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old\\r\\nman, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some\\r\\ntime and have been waiting for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said he,\\r\\nseizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have long been\\r\\nwishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up\\r\\nhoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.[187] But tell me,\\r\\ndoes Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not trouble about\\r\\nthat.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses\\r\\nto give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took their\\r\\nseats in due order near Dolius their father.\"\n",

BIAGIO INGROIA,\\r\\nPREZIOSO ALLEATO\\r\\nL’AUTORE RICONOSCENTE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\\n\\r\\nThis translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The Authoress of\\r\\nthe Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give the whole “Odyssey”\\r\\nin that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore epitomised my translation,\\r\\nwhich was already completed and which I now publish in full.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\\r\\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I have\\r\\nthere written. The points in question are:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely from, the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike as regards the\\r\\nPhaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of Ulysses, when once he is\\r\\nwithin easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves into a periplus of the island,\\r\\npractically from Trapani back to Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits\\r\\nof Messina, and the island of Pantellaria.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived at the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work under the name\\r\\nof Nausicaa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\\r\\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English and\\r\\nItalian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the “Athenaeum”\\r\\nfor January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were urged (also without\\r\\nrejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle” for the Lent and October terms of the same\\r\\nyear. Nothing to which I should reply has reached me from any quarter, and\\r\\nknowing how anxiously I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in\\r\\nmy argument, I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I\\r\\nshould have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,\\r\\ntherefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce\\r\\nin my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\\r\\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself to\\r\\ntranslating the “Odyssey” for English readers, with such notes as I think will\\r\\nbe found useful. Among these I would especially call attention to one on xxii.\\r\\n465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly allowed me to make public.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of the\\r\\nOdyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court of Ulysses’\\r\\nhouse more vividly before the reader. I should like to explain that the\\r\\npresence of a man and a dog in one illustration is accidental, and was not\\r\\nobserved by me till I developed the negative. In an appendix I have also\\r\\nreprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the plan of Ulysses’ house, together\\r\\nwith the plan itself. The reader is recommended to study this plan with some\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views as to the\\r\\nmain principles by which a translator should be guided, and need not repeat\\r\\nthem here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of translating poetry\\r\\ninto prose involves the continual taking of more or less liberty throughout the\\r\\ntranslation; for much that is right in poetry is wrong in prose, and the\\r\\nexigencies of readable prose are the first things to be considered in a prose\\r\\ntranslation. That the reader, however, may see how far I have departed from\\r\\nstrict construe, I will print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of\\r\\nthe sixty lines or so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAnd Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I\\r\\nam Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here\\r\\nwith my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for\\r\\nTemesa[4] with a\\r\\ncargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over\\r\\nyonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron[5] under the wooded\\r\\nmountain Neritum.[6]\\r\\nOur fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will\\r\\ngo and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives\\r\\nby himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him\\r\\nand get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his\\r\\nvineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came,\\r\\nbut it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\\r\\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or\\r\\na prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\r\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon\\r\\nme from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is\\r\\na man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find\\r\\nsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses\\r\\nreally have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully\\r\\nlike him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail\\r\\nfor Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have\\r\\nnever either of us seen the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a\\r\\nwise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had\\r\\ngrown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more\\r\\nill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope\\r\\nhas such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the\\r\\nmeaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?\\r\\nHave you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family—for no one seems to\\r\\nbe bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests—how atrociously they are\\r\\nbehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any\\r\\nrespectable person who comes near them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father was\\r\\nhere it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure\\r\\nhave willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man\\r\\nwas ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if\\r\\nhe had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him\\r\\nwhen the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built\\r\\na mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but\\r\\nnow the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\r\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but\\r\\ndismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father;\\r\\nheaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all\\r\\nour islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all\\r\\nthe principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of\\r\\npaying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will\\r\\nnot marry,[7] nor yet\\r\\nbring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long\\r\\nwill do so also with myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.\\r\\nGive him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is the man he\\r\\nwas when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would\\r\\nsoon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more\\r\\nupon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to\\r\\nbeg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the\\r\\never-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some,\\r\\nfor he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors\\r\\nwill have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take\\r\\nhis revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about\\r\\ntrying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean\\r\\nheroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your case before them, and call heaven\\r\\nto bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own\\r\\nplace, and if your mother’s mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to\\r\\nher father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage\\r\\ngifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\\r\\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in\\r\\nquest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you\\r\\nsomething, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent\\r\\nmessage may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to\\r\\nSparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you\\r\\nhear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the\\r\\nwaste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other\\r\\nhand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\r\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again.\\r\\nThen, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means\\r\\nor foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\r\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes’ praises\\r\\nfor having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart\\r\\nlooking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now,\\r\\nhowever, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I\\r\\nkeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what\\r\\nI have said to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this\\r\\nway, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you\\r\\nwant to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have\\r\\ntaken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you\\r\\nshall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value—a\\r\\nkeepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As\\r\\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and\\r\\nI will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give\\r\\nyou one of no less value in return.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given\\r\\nTelemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He\\r\\nfelt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so\\r\\nhe went straight to where the suitors were sitting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the\\r\\nsad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the\\r\\nAchaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs,\\r\\nand came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her\\r\\nhandmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts\\r\\nthat supported the roof of the cloisters[8] with a staid maiden on either side of\\r\\nher. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as\\r\\npoets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink\\r\\ntheir wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful\\r\\nheart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and\\r\\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.”[9]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards\\r\\ndo not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and\\r\\nwho sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This\\r\\nfellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people\\r\\nalways applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear\\r\\nit; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another\\r\\nwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for\\r\\nspeech is man’s matter, and mine above all others [10]—for it is I who am master here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were\\r\\nclamorous throughout the covered cloisters[11], and prayed each one that he might be\\r\\nher bed fellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors, let us\\r\\nfeast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing\\r\\nto hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet\\r\\nme in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at\\r\\none another’s houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other\\r\\nhand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove\\r\\nshall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there\\r\\nshall be no man to avenge you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of\\r\\nhis speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The gods seem to have\\r\\ngiven you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be\\r\\nchief in Ithaca as your father was before you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will\\r\\nbe chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no\\r\\nbad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that\\r\\nUlysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some\\r\\nother may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own\\r\\nhouse, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to decide who\\r\\nshall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over\\r\\nyour own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you\\r\\nviolence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this\\r\\nstranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is\\r\\nhis estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he\\r\\non business of his own? He seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so\\r\\nsuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some rumour\\r\\nreaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send\\r\\nfor a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old\\r\\nfriend of my father’s.” But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but\\r\\nwhen night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own\\r\\nabode.[12]\\r\\nTelemachus’s room was high up in a tower[13] that looked on to the outer court;\\r\\nhither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman,\\r\\nEuryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of\\r\\nblazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite\\r\\nyoung; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to\\r\\nher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her\\r\\nto his bed for he feared his wife’s resentment.[14] She it was who now lighted Telemachus\\r\\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house\\r\\ndid, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed\\r\\nroom and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt[15] he gave it to the good old woman, who\\r\\nfolded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\r\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt\\r\\nhome by means of the strap.[16] But Telemachus as he lay covered with\\r\\na woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of\\r\\nthe counsel that Minerva had given him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK II\\n\\r\\nASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE\\r\\nSUITORS—TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH MINERVA\\r\\nDISGUISED AS MENTOR.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once\\r\\nsent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and\\r\\nthe people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the\\r\\nplace of assembly spear in hand—not alone, for his two hounds went with him.\\r\\nMinerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all\\r\\nmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat\\r\\neven the oldest councillors made way for him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more. There is\\r\\nno chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long since counselled\\r\\nhis destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to\\r\\nask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has\\r\\nreigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell\\r\\nme, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that\\r\\nway? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far\\r\\nbetter a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\\r\\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself divined\\r\\nhow it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus\\r\\nstill alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him,\\r\\nnot even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to\\r\\ndogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a\\r\\ndeed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and\\r\\nAegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled\\r\\nAgamemnon’s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a\\r\\ngood natural disposition;[30] moreover there was a bard with her,\\r\\nto whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was\\r\\nto keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction,\\r\\nAegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows\\r\\nand seagulls to batten upon—after which she went willingly enough to the house\\r\\nof Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated\\r\\nmany temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his\\r\\nexpectations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with\\r\\none another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with\\r\\nhis painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus’ ship (and never\\r\\nman knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then\\r\\nand there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press\\r\\nforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\\r\\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far\\r\\nas the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard\\r\\ntill the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\\r\\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the\\r\\nriver Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea\\r\\nfrom a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as\\r\\nPhaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after\\r\\nPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\\r\\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked;\\r\\nbut the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships,\\r\\nthey were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold\\r\\nand substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home\\r\\nplotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled\\r\\nin Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\\r\\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\\r\\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false\\r\\nAegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus\\r\\ncame home,[31] with\\r\\nas much treasure as his ships could carry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home,\\r\\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat\\r\\nup everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand.\\r\\nStill, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has\\r\\nlately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope\\r\\nto get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his\\r\\nreckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and\\r\\nterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and\\r\\ntake your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have\\r\\na chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\\r\\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will\\r\\ntell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, “Sir, all\\r\\nthat you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to\\r\\nbe cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other\\r\\nimmortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early\\r\\nand not keep late hours at a religious festival.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\\r\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\\r\\nwith wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink\\r\\noffering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood\\r\\nup to make their drink offerings. When they had made their offerings and had\\r\\ndrunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on\\r\\nboard their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should leave my\\r\\nhouse to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes,\\r\\nor that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both\\r\\nfor myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and\\r\\ncloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on\\r\\nthe deck of a ship—not while I live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they\\r\\nwill keep open house as I have done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better\\r\\nthat Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with\\r\\nyou and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and\\r\\nkeep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are\\r\\nall young men of Telemachus’ own age, who have taken this voyage out of\\r\\nfriendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I\\r\\nmust go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me.\\r\\nAs for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a\\r\\nchariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him\\r\\nwith your best and fleetest horses.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to the\\r\\nabode of Menelaus[36] [and found him in his own house,\\r\\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also\\r\\nof his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\\r\\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still\\r\\nat Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending\\r\\nher with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’\\r\\nson was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta,[37] the daughter of\\r\\nAlector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\\r\\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as\\r\\ngolden Venus herself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his\\r\\nhouse. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\\r\\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with\\r\\nhis tune.[38]\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon\\r\\nEteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying\\r\\nback into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said,\\r\\n“Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of\\r\\nJove. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find\\r\\nfriends elsewhere as they best can?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never used to\\r\\nbe a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course,\\r\\nand show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have staid often\\r\\nenough at other people’s houses before we got back here, where heaven grant\\r\\nthat we may rest in peace henceforward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They took\\r\\ntheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and\\r\\ngave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against\\r\\nthe end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus were astonished when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of\\r\\nthe sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything to their heart’s\\r\\ncontent, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them\\r\\nwoollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of\\r\\nMenelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and\\r\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a\\r\\nclean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them\\r\\nmany good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them\\r\\nplates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have done\\r\\nsupper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have\\r\\nbeen lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor\\r\\npeople do not have such sons as you are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he handed them[39] a piece of fat roast loin, which had\\r\\nbeen set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\\r\\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\r\\nTelemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might\\r\\nhear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and\\r\\ngold—of amber,[40]\\r\\nivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace\\r\\nof Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove,\\r\\nfor his house and everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men—well,\\r\\nthere may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not; but at\\r\\nall events I have travelled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was\\r\\nnearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus,\\r\\nPhoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and\\r\\nthe Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\\r\\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\\r\\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes\\r\\nyield all the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\\r\\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the\\r\\nperfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all\\r\\nthis wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all\\r\\nthis, and of my heavy loss in the ruin[41] of a stately mansion fully and\\r\\nmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so\\r\\nthat I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain\\r\\nof Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and\\r\\nall of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again,\\r\\nfor crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I\\r\\nmay, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\\r\\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one\\r\\nof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing\\r\\nby it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long\\r\\ntime, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his\\r\\nlong-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him\\r\\nan infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of\\r\\nhis father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he\\r\\nheld his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus saw this he\\r\\ndoubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at\\r\\nonce and find what it was all about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\\r\\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her a seat,\\r\\nAlcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which\\r\\nAlcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which\\r\\nis the richest city in the whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of\\r\\npure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife\\r\\ngave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work\\r\\nbox that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\\r\\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet\\r\\ncoloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her\\r\\nfeet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.[42]\\n---------new doc---------\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she exclaimed,\\r\\n“ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a\\r\\ngoddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So\\r\\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you\\r\\nfurious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in\\r\\nlove with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove\\r\\ncame to hear of it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts.\\r\\nAnd now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor\\r\\ncreature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with\\r\\nlightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\\r\\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and\\r\\ncherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should\\r\\nnever grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels\\r\\nto nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas\\r\\nagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men\\r\\nwho can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good\\r\\nfaith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and punish\\r\\nyou”.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she\\r\\nhad heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes\\r\\never filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired\\r\\nof Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it\\r\\nwas she, not he, that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the\\r\\nrocks and on the sea shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always\\r\\nlooking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out\\r\\nany longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some\\r\\nbeams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may\\r\\ncarry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to\\r\\nsave you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair\\r\\nwind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it—for they know more\\r\\nabout these things, and can settle them better than I can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there is\\r\\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when\\r\\nyou bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well\\r\\nfound ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing\\r\\nthat you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first\\r\\nsolemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a great deal,”\\r\\nsaid she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my\\r\\nwitnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this is the most solemn oath\\r\\nwhich a blessed god can take—that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only\\r\\nadvising you to do exactly what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing\\r\\nwith you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very\\r\\nsorry for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they\\r\\ncame to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury had just left.\\r\\nCalypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her\\r\\nmaids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the\\r\\ngood things that were before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat\\r\\nand drink, Calypso spoke, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own land at\\r\\nonce? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much suffering is\\r\\nin store for you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where\\r\\nyou are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how\\r\\nanxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the\\r\\ntime day after day; yet I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or\\r\\nwell-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman\\r\\nshould compare in beauty with an immortal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am quite\\r\\naware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as\\r\\nyourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I\\r\\nwant to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I\\r\\nam on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had infinite\\r\\ntrouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the\\r\\ninner part of the cave and went to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on his shirt\\r\\nand cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine\\r\\nand graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to\\r\\ncover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on\\r\\nhis way. So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was\\r\\nsharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on\\r\\nto it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\\r\\nthe island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached\\r\\nthe sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water.[53] Then, when she\\r\\nhad shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\\r\\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed\\r\\nthem smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\\r\\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the\\r\\ntimbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\\r\\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the\\r\\nribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and\\r\\na rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\\r\\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and\\r\\nby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too,\\r\\nexcellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the\\r\\nhelp of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should\\r\\nhave his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made\\r\\ntheir drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went\\r\\nhome to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with\\r\\nArete and Alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper.\\r\\nArete was the first to speak, for she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good\\r\\nclothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so\\r\\nshe said, “Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\\r\\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\r\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full\\r\\nthe tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me;\\r\\nbut as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is\\r\\ncalled ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso,\\r\\ndaughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or\\r\\ndivine. Fortune, however, brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for\\r\\nJove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My\\r\\nbrave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was\\r\\ncarried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\r\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the\\r\\ngreat goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost\\r\\nkindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\r\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the\\r\\neighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because\\r\\nJove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind. She sent me\\r\\nfrom her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and\\r\\nwine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew\\r\\nboth warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the\\r\\neighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your\\r\\ncoast—and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still\\r\\nmuch trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no\\r\\nfurther, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that\\r\\nI could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the\\r\\ngale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves\\r\\ndashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came\\r\\nto a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks\\r\\nand it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and\\r\\ngathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so I left the river,\\r\\nand went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and\\r\\npresently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I\\r\\nslept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when\\r\\nI woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing\\r\\nupon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\r\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than\\r\\ncould be expected from so young a person—for young people are apt to be\\r\\nthoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me\\r\\nwashed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now,\\r\\ntherefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring\\r\\nyou on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she was the first\\r\\nperson whose aid you asked.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did tell me\\r\\nto follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you\\r\\nmight perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a\\r\\nlittle suspicious and irritable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry about\\r\\nnothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and\\r\\nApollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I\\r\\ndo, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If\\r\\nyou will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid)\\r\\nshall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I\\r\\nwill attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep[64] during the whole\\r\\nvoyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to\\r\\nyour own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off\\r\\nthan Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired\\r\\nRhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any\\r\\nplace—and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing\\r\\nthemselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\\r\\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that\\r\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable name\\r\\namong mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that\\r\\nwas in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets\\r\\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon\\r\\nwent out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came\\r\\nup to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is\\r\\nready,” and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\r\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\r\\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and\\r\\nUlysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly,\\r\\nwhich was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a\\r\\nseat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous’\\r\\nservants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She\\r\\nwent up to the citizens, man by man, and said, “Aldermen and town councillors\\r\\nof the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger\\r\\nwho has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\\r\\nlike an immortal god.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\\r\\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck\\r\\nwith the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head\\r\\nand shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he\\r\\nmight impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and\\r\\nmight come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge\\r\\nhim. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I\\r\\nmay speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his\\r\\nway to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort\\r\\nand wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we\\r\\nhave done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house\\r\\nhas been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us\\r\\ndraw a ship into the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with\\r\\ntwo and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your\\r\\noars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a\\r\\nfeast.[65] I will\\r\\nfind you in everything. I am giving these instructions to the young men who\\r\\nwill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\\r\\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and\\r\\nwe will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he\\r\\nmay choose to sing about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went\\r\\nto fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they\\r\\nhad been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got\\r\\nher mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\\r\\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They\\r\\nmoored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went\\r\\nto the house of King Alcinous. The out houses,[66] yards, and all the precincts were\\r\\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous\\r\\nkilled them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they\\r\\nskinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly\\r\\nloved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed\\r\\nhim with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous\\r\\nset a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He\\r\\nhung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to\\r\\nfeel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals\\r\\nby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so\\r\\ndisposed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,\\r\\nbut as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired\\r\\nDemodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was\\r\\nthen in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and\\r\\nAchilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat\\r\\ntogether at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains\\r\\nquarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the\\r\\nevil that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\\r\\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was\\r\\nweeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\\r\\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but\\r\\nwhen the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in\\r\\nhis lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.\\r\\nNo one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\\r\\nheard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast,\\r\\nand of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\\r\\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to\\r\\ntell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers,\\r\\njumpers, and runners.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him\\r\\non the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were\\r\\ngoing to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them,\\r\\nand there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos,\\r\\nOcyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus,\\r\\nThoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also\\r\\nEuryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\\r\\nman among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\r\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting\\r\\npost, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the\\r\\nsame moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else\\r\\nbehind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a\\r\\nfallow field.[67]\\r\\nThey then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to\\r\\nbe the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at\\r\\nthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son\\r\\nLaodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had\\r\\nall been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in\\r\\nany of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands,\\r\\nand neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered\\r\\nmuch lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no\\r\\nmatter how strong he is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest and\\r\\nspeak to him about it yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said\\r\\nto Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of\\r\\nour competitions if you are skilled in any of them—and you must have gone in\\r\\nfor many a one before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit\\r\\nall his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet.\\r\\nHave a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your\\r\\nreturn home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the\\r\\nwater, and the crew is found.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set\\r\\nrather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble, and am\\r\\ncome among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me\\r\\non my return home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on a site\\r\\nthat could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild\\r\\nmountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor bewitched creatures whom\\r\\nshe had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not\\r\\nattack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their\\r\\nnoses lovingly against them.[86] As hounds crowd round their master\\r\\nwhen they see him coming from dinner—for they know he will bring them\\r\\nsomething—even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon\\r\\nmy men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.\\r\\nPresently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they stood\\r\\nthere they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\\r\\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours as no one\\r\\nbut a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than\\r\\nany other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working at a loom and\\r\\nsinging most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and\\r\\nsee whether she is woman or goddess.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter.\\r\\nThey, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected\\r\\nmischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them\\r\\nupon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and\\r\\nPramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their\\r\\nhomes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her\\r\\nwand, and shut them up in her pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and\\r\\nall, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as\\r\\nbefore, and they remembered everything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and\\r\\nbeech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the\\r\\nsad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried\\r\\nto speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he\\r\\ncould only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he\\r\\ntold us what had happened to the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of\\r\\nit there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen\\r\\nfrom far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her\\r\\nloom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she\\r\\nat once came down, opened the door, and invited us in. The others did not\\r\\nsuspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I staid where I\\r\\nwas, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them\\r\\nno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\\r\\nfor them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my\\r\\nbow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way. But he laid\\r\\nhold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not force\\r\\nme to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of\\r\\nthem back with you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we\\r\\ncannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save\\r\\nour lives.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the ship, but\\r\\nI must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed\\r\\ngrove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury\\r\\nwith his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and\\r\\nbeauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my\\r\\nhand within his own, saying, ‘My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over\\r\\nthis mountain top, alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in\\r\\nCirce’s pigstyes, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\\r\\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back\\r\\nand will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will\\r\\nprotect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of\\r\\ngreat virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe’s house, it will be a\\r\\ntalisman to you against every kind of mischief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to\\r\\npractice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will drug the\\r\\nmeal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the\\r\\nvirtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working.\\r\\nI will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your\\r\\nsword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her. She will then\\r\\nbe frightened, and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not\\r\\npoint blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to\\r\\ntake good care also of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all\\r\\nthe blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else\\r\\nwhen she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it was\\r\\nlike. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call\\r\\nit Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they\\r\\nlike.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I\\r\\nfared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I\\r\\nwalked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and\\r\\nas soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come\\r\\nin; so I followed her—much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly\\r\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet,\\r\\nand she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it,\\r\\nfor she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without\\r\\nits charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off\\r\\nto the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon\\r\\nshe fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying,\\r\\n‘Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you come? How can it\\r\\nbe that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man able to\\r\\nstand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be spell-proof;\\r\\nsurely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always\\r\\nsaid would come here some day with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so\\r\\nbe it then; sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends\\r\\nand learn to trust each other.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Mother,’ said I, ‘I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean land nor set\\r\\nfoot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of\\r\\nmisfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilius,\\r\\nthe land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nin what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe\\r\\nyou a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the\\r\\nson whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one\\r\\nelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me\\r\\nagain what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with\\r\\nmy son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could\\r\\nand married again?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in\\r\\ngreat distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day.\\r\\nNo one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still\\r\\nholds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of course he\\r\\nmust, considering his position as a magistrate,[92] and how every one invites him; your\\r\\nfather remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the town. He\\r\\nhas no comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\\r\\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\\r\\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\\r\\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never\\r\\nhaving come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own\\r\\nend it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my\\r\\nown house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear\\r\\npeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the\\r\\nforce of my affection for you—this it was that was the death of me.’[93]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost. Thrice I\\r\\nsprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time she flitted\\r\\nfrom my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick I\\r\\nsaid to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we\\r\\ncould throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the\\r\\nsharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay\\r\\na still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine\\r\\nthat is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are dead. The\\r\\nsinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the\\r\\nfierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul\\r\\nflits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day\\r\\nas soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your\\r\\nwife hereafter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and\\r\\ndaughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood,\\r\\nand I considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nit would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep\\r\\nthem from all drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other,\\r\\nand each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus\\r\\nthe son of Aeolus.[94] She fell in love with the river\\r\\nEnipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\\r\\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay\\r\\nwith her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched itself like a\\r\\nmountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin\\r\\ngirdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed\\r\\nof love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will;\\r\\nthe embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about\\r\\nthis time twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home,\\r\\nbut hold your tongue and do not tell any one.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who\\r\\nboth of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of\\r\\nsheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. The rest of her\\r\\nchildren were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a\\r\\nmighty warrior and charioteer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of having slept\\r\\nin the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethus.\\r\\nThese founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it; for\\r\\nstrong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable\\r\\nHercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon, and married the\\r\\nredoubtable son of Amphitryon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it was to\\r\\nmarry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after having killed his\\r\\nfather, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he\\r\\nremained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him;\\r\\nbut Epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged\\r\\nherself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged\\r\\nmother—to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given priceless\\r\\npresents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of\\r\\nMinyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore Nestor, Chromius, and\\r\\nPericlymenus, and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was\\r\\nwooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who\\r\\nshould raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and\\r\\nthis was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a\\r\\ncertain excellent seer,[95] but the will of heaven was against\\r\\nhim, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;\\r\\nnevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season came round again,\\r\\nIphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\\r\\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor\\r\\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying\\r\\nunder the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of\\r\\nJove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day\\r\\nthroughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles,\\r\\ntook away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she\\r\\nbleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes\\r\\nand threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer\\r\\ngarment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a\\r\\ntwisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went\\r\\nstraight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\r\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded\\r\\ncountry and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where\\r\\nMinerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty\\r\\nservant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the\\r\\nyards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made\\r\\nthem spacious[126] and fair to see, with a free run\\r\\nfor the pigs all round them; he had built them during his master’s absence, of\\r\\nstones which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to\\r\\nPenelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside\\r\\nthe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close\\r\\ntogether, while inside he had built twelve styes near one another for the sows\\r\\nto lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding\\r\\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the\\r\\nsuitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had\\r\\ncontinually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman’s\\r\\nfour hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The\\r\\nswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals[127] from a good\\r\\nstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or\\r\\nanother, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced\\r\\nto send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but\\r\\nUlysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he\\r\\nhad in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead\\r\\nhad not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate\\r\\nof the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them.\\r\\nThen he said to Ulysses, “Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work\\r\\nof you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me\\r\\nquite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am\\r\\nin continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to\\r\\neat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some\\r\\ndistant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and\\r\\nwine, tell me where you come from, and all about your misfortunes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He\\r\\nstrewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he\\r\\nthrew the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he used to sleep by\\r\\nnight. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said “May Jove, sir,\\r\\nand the rest of the gods grant you your heart’s desire in return for the kind\\r\\nway in which you have received me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still poorer man\\r\\nshould come here, it would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers\\r\\nand beggars are from Jove. You must take what you can get and be thankful, for\\r\\nservants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is\\r\\nmy misfortune now, for heaven has hindered the return of him who would have\\r\\nbeen always good to me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of\\r\\nland, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\\r\\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they\\r\\nhave mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he\\r\\nwould have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen’s\\r\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good\\r\\nman. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds,\\r\\nto fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where the young\\r\\nsucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and\\r\\nsacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted them; when the meat was\\r\\ncooked he brought it all in and set it before Ulysses, hot and still on the\\r\\nspit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd\\r\\nthen mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told\\r\\nhim to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat pigs have\\r\\nto go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed\\r\\ngods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is lawful and\\r\\nright. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and\\r\\nJove gives them their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and\\r\\ngot home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but\\r\\nsome god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\r\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\r\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear or\\r\\nstint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one\\r\\nvictim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly\\r\\nrich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he\\r\\nwas; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.\\r\\nThere are twelve herds of cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of\\r\\nsheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired\\r\\nstrangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he\\r\\nruns even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in\\r\\nthe charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the\\r\\nbest goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs\\r\\nthat you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending\\r\\nit to them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously without\\r\\na word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the\\r\\nswineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and\\r\\ngave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, “My\\r\\nfriend, who was this master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich\\r\\nand so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King\\r\\nAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove\\r\\nand the other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have\\r\\ntravelled much.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war\\r\\ncry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen\\r\\nand foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my\\r\\nmen, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves\\r\\nsurrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do\\r\\nforced labour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I wish\\r\\nI had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store\\r\\nfor me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\r\\nI went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them,\\r\\nwhereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to\\r\\nhis own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kill me in\\r\\ntheir fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the\\r\\nprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\r\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on for\\r\\neight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already\\r\\ncommitted all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with\\r\\nhim to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months and days had gone\\r\\nby till the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\\r\\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that\\r\\nplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I\\r\\nfetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not\\r\\nhelp it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies\\r\\nbetween Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their destruction, for\\r\\nas soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky,\\r\\nhe raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then\\r\\nJove let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was\\r\\nfilled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all\\r\\ninto the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like\\r\\nso many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\r\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s mast within my\\r\\nreach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of\\r\\nthe gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great\\r\\nwave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the\\r\\nThesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all—for\\r\\nhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he\\r\\nraised me by the hand, took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to\\r\\nwear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had\\r\\nentertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward\\r\\njourney. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so\\r\\nmuch had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had\\r\\ngone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the god’s high oak tree,\\r\\nand know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or\\r\\nin secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in\\r\\nhis own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew\\r\\nfound, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\r\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be\\r\\nsure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very\\r\\nextreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land they\\r\\nresolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that\\r\\nI was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see\\r\\nme; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there\\r\\nthey bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to\\r\\nget supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\\r\\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck\\r\\nout and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\r\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went\\r\\nsearching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and\\r\\nwent back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me\\r\\nto a good man’s door—for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I have found\\r\\nthe story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that part about\\r\\nUlysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. Why should a man\\r\\nlike you go about telling lies in this way? I know all about the return of my\\r\\nmaster. The gods one and all of them detest him, or they would have taken him\\r\\nbefore Troy, or let him die with friends around him when the days of his\\r\\nfighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\r\\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds\\r\\nhave spirited him away we know not whither.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town\\r\\nunless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about Ulysses.\\r\\nThen they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the\\r\\nking’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it. For my own part I have never cared about asking\\r\\nanyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a\\r\\nman and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind\\r\\nto him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting\\r\\nhis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the\\r\\nfollowing summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much\\r\\nwealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\r\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any\\r\\nsuch reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the\\r\\ngod of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you\\r\\nmy oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call\\r\\nall the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a\\r\\ncloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but\\r\\nif he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and tell them to\\r\\nthrow me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the\\r\\ncountry telling lies.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and\\r\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing\\r\\nyou hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but\\r\\nit is just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may\\r\\ncook something savoury for supper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs,\\r\\nwhich were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a tremendous\\r\\nsquealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus called to\\r\\nhis men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice him for\\r\\nthis stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble\\r\\nenough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five\\r\\nyear old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not forget the gods,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut\\r\\nbristles from the pig’s face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the\\r\\ngods as he did so that Ulysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig\\r\\nwith a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,\\r\\nand stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it\\r\\nup, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the\\r\\nfat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut\\r\\nthe rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\r\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on\\r\\nto the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then\\r\\nstood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he\\r\\nset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did\\r\\nso; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices\\r\\ncut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much\\r\\npleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well disposed\\r\\ntowards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like\\r\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your\\r\\nsupper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks\\r\\nright, for he can do whatever he chooses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to\\r\\nthe immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands\\r\\nof Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius brought them their\\r\\nbread; the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the\\r\\nTaphians during his master’s absence, and had paid for him with his own money\\r\\nwithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their\\r\\nhands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough\\r\\nto eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all\\r\\nwent to bed after having made a hearty supper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured\\r\\nwithout ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet\\r\\nquarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the excellent care\\r\\nhe took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of\\r\\nhis men give him one. “Listen to me,” said he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you;\\r\\nwhen I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes\\r\\nme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will\\r\\nmake him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\\r\\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young\\r\\nand strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses\\r\\nwere the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it\\r\\nso. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our\\r\\narmour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\r\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell\\r\\nsmall and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\\r\\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with\\r\\ntheir shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind\\r\\nme, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my\\r\\nshirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had\\r\\nshifted their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and\\r\\nhe at once gave me his ear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak;\\r\\nsome god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, and I do not\\r\\nknow what to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following plan:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’ Then he\\r\\nraised his head on his elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a\\r\\nlong way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell Agamemnon to\\r\\nsend us up more men at once.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the\\r\\nships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning.\\r\\nWould that I were still young and strong as I was in those days, for then some\\r\\none of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the\\r\\nrespect due to a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my\\r\\nclothes are shabby.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story, and have\\r\\nsaid nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore,\\r\\nyou shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress\\r\\nmay reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old\\r\\nrags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up\\r\\nhere, but every man has only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will\\r\\ngive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins and\\r\\nsheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay down, and\\r\\nEumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in\\r\\ncase of extraordinarily bad weather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd\\r\\ndid not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go outside, and\\r\\nUlysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master’s\\r\\nabsence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick\\r\\ncloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a large and well fed goat,\\r\\nand a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his\\r\\nrest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them\\r\\nshelter from the North wind.\\n---------new doc---------\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\\r\\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as he did\\r\\nso. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the house, and they\\r\\nboth of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a\\r\\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\r\\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them\\r\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\\r\\nEteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes\\r\\npoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\r\\nbefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove\\r\\nout through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\\r\\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in\\r\\nfront of the horses and pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see\\r\\nthat you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any\\r\\nfather could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as soon as\\r\\nwe see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned when I get\\r\\nback to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have shown\\r\\nme and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a great\\r\\nwhite goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard—and all\\r\\nthe men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up to\\r\\nthem and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw\\r\\nit they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon\\r\\nPisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but\\r\\nHelen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this matter as heaven has\\r\\nput it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle\\r\\ncame from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner\\r\\nUlysses, after having travelled far and suffered much, will return to take his\\r\\nrevenge—if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the\\r\\nsuitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be so, I\\r\\nwill make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the\\r\\ntown towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and\\r\\ntravelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus,\\r\\nthe son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated hospitably.\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their\\r\\nhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner\\r\\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus\\r\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\\r\\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You\\r\\nknow our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age,\\r\\nand this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not, therefore,\\r\\ntake me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father’s house he\\r\\nwill try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go\\r\\nhome at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed\\r\\nit best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s beautiful\\r\\npresents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said, “Go on\\r\\nboard at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell\\r\\nmy father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he\\r\\nwill come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he\\r\\nwill be very angry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon\\r\\nreached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave his orders.\\r\\n“Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on board the ship, and let us\\r\\nset out home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\\r\\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in the\\r\\nship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was\\r\\nflying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus,\\r\\nwho used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great\\r\\nhouse, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus.\\r\\nNeleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a\\r\\nclose prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both\\r\\non account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great\\r\\nsorrow that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped\\r\\nwith his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that\\r\\nhad been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left\\r\\nthe country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over\\r\\nmuch people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons\\r\\nAntiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of\\r\\nAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not\\r\\nlive to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His\\r\\nsons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was\\r\\nfather to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\\r\\nfor his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made\\r\\nPolypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.\\r\\nHe quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained\\r\\nand prophesied for all men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making\\r\\ndrink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now that I find\\r\\nyou sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and\\r\\nby the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those\\r\\nof your followers tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence\\r\\nare you? Tell me also of your town and parents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my\\r\\nfather is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some\\r\\nmiserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see\\r\\nif I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia,[134] where the land\\r\\nbegins to turn round and look in another direction.[135] It is not very thickly peopled, but\\r\\nthe soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds\\r\\nwith wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by\\r\\nany sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\\r\\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is\\r\\ndivided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable\\r\\nto the gods, reigned over both.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the\\r\\nPhoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with gewgaws\\r\\nof all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father’s house,\\r\\nvery tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of\\r\\nher one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her\\r\\nin ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The\\r\\nman who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\\r\\nthis she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am\\r\\ndaughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the\\r\\ntown from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the\\r\\nsea, where they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their\\r\\nprice for me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along with us\\r\\nto see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? They are both\\r\\nalive and are said to be well off.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a solemn\\r\\noath that you will do me no harm by the way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath the\\r\\nwoman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the\\r\\nwell, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and tell my\\r\\nmaster, in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison,\\r\\nand would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your\\r\\nmerchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I\\r\\nwill bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else\\r\\nalso that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\\r\\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry\\r\\nhim off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you\\r\\ntake him and sell him in foreign parts.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till\\r\\nthey had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they\\r\\nhad got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very\\r\\ncunning fellow, came to my father’s house bringing a necklace of gold with\\r\\namber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in\\r\\ntheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the\\r\\nwoman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\\r\\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\\r\\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance\\r\\non him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she\\r\\nsnatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I\\r\\nfollowed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over\\r\\nall the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\\r\\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed\\r\\ntheir ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind;\\r\\nsix days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck\\r\\nthe woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were a\\r\\nsea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and\\r\\nfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves\\r\\ntook the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and\\r\\nthus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the\\r\\nmost lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as well as evil, for\\r\\nin spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you always have\\r\\nenough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going\\r\\nabout begging my way from city to city.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep,\\r\\nfor it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his crew were nearing\\r\\nland, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the\\r\\nharbour.[136]\\r\\nThey cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out\\r\\nupon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had\\r\\nhad enough to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but\\r\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the\\r\\nevening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and\\r\\nto-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner\\r\\nwith meat and wine.” [137]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To\\r\\nwhose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I go straight\\r\\nto your own house and to your mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go to my own\\r\\nhouse, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment,\\r\\nhowever, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my mother\\r\\nwill not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits\\r\\nat her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a\\r\\nman whose house you can go to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held\\r\\nin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and\\r\\nthe most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\\r\\ntrying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows whether or\\r\\nno they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s\\r\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them\\r\\noff,[138] fell to\\r\\nthe ground midway between Telemachus and the ship. On this Theoclymenus called\\r\\nhim apart and caught him by the hand. “Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not\\r\\nfly on your right hand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I\\r\\nsaw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that\\r\\nthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show you so\\r\\nmuch good will and give you so many presents that all who meet you will\\r\\ncongratulate you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say.\\r\\nTwenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhither; but\\r\\nI will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple\\r\\nwool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for\\r\\nthe pin. On the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a\\r\\nspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the\\r\\nground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in\\r\\ngold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was\\r\\nstruggling convulsively to escape.[153] As for the shirt that he wore next\\r\\nhis skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\r\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it.\\r\\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether\\r\\nUlysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions\\r\\nhad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose\\r\\nhouse he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\\r\\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of\\r\\nbronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down\\r\\nto his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had\\r\\na servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\r\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched,[154] he was dark, and he had thick curly\\r\\nhair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity\\r\\nthan he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that\\r\\nUlysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said\\r\\nto him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall\\r\\nbe honoured and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes\\r\\nyou speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and\\r\\nI gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\\r\\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\\r\\ndetested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\\r\\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you\\r\\nfor doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would\\r\\nnaturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than\\r\\nUlysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to\\r\\nwhat I can tell you. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect\\r\\ntruth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home;\\r\\nhe is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that\\r\\nhe has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were\\r\\nlost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were\\r\\nangry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they\\r\\nwere all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was\\r\\ndrifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals,\\r\\nand who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and\\r\\nwishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\r\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\\r\\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare\\r\\nwith him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to\\r\\nme—making drink-offerings in his house as he did so—that the ship was by the\\r\\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He\\r\\nsent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\r\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\\r\\nthat he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after\\r\\nso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may\\r\\nknow he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain\\r\\naway from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath,\\r\\nand call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also\\r\\nthat hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall\\r\\nsurely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\\r\\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you shall have\\r\\nsuch gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate\\r\\nyou; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will not return, neither will\\r\\nyou get your escort hence, for so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are\\r\\nnow no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to receive honourable\\r\\nstrangers or to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his\\r\\nfeet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\\r\\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him\\r\\nagain, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\r\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him;\\r\\nlike it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall\\r\\nyou be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in\\r\\ngoodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid\\r\\nand ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal\\r\\nhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak\\r\\ncontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals\\r\\nrighteously, the people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\\r\\nhim blessed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that\\r\\nI left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain\\r\\non many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any\\r\\nrough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my\\r\\nfeet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my\\r\\nfeet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\\r\\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my\\r\\nhouse there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety\\r\\nas you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman—the\\r\\nsame who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and\\r\\nnursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.”\\r\\n“Come here,” said she, “Euryclea, and wash your master’s age-mate; I suppose\\r\\nUlysses’ hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages\\r\\nall of us dreadfully fast.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed\\r\\nabout as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire,\\r\\ndoing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as\\r\\nsoon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking\\r\\nall the time how, single handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large\\r\\na body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from\\r\\nheaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor\\r\\nunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is\\r\\nsafe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father\\r\\nmay be proud of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am in some\\r\\ndoubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed,\\r\\nseeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further\\r\\ndifficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Jove’s and\\r\\nyour assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I\\r\\nam to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse ally than\\r\\nmyself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I\\r\\nnot a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles? I\\r\\ntell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us\\r\\nand eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive\\r\\nthem away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all\\r\\nnight, and you shall be out of your troubles before long.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed\\r\\nbegan to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Diana\\r\\nsaying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart\\r\\nand slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of\\r\\ndarkness till it drop me into the mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the\\r\\ndaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and\\r\\nmother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took\\r\\ncare of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them\\r\\nto excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an\\r\\nimposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\\r\\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them\\r\\nmarried (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to\\r\\nevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to\\r\\nthe dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide\\r\\nme from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go\\r\\neven beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only,\\r\\nand without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no\\r\\nmatter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as\\r\\nthey can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget\\r\\ngood and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\\r\\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was\\r\\nwhen he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no\\r\\ndream, but the very truth itself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it\\r\\npuzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side.\\r\\nThen he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set\\r\\nthem on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s hide out into the\\r\\nopen. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying “Father Jove, since\\r\\nyou have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the\\r\\nafflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\\r\\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another\\r\\nsign of some kind from outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among\\r\\nthe clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard\\r\\nit. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill\\r\\nroom lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve\\r\\nmiller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the\\r\\nstaff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take their\\r\\nrest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they\\r\\nwere, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to\\r\\nher master. “Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you\\r\\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this\\r\\nmeans something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant\\r\\nwho calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in\\r\\nthe house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\\r\\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s speech,\\r\\nand by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the\\r\\nsuitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\r\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about his\\r\\nshoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a doughty spear\\r\\nwith a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister\\r\\nand said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as\\r\\nregards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?—for my mother,\\r\\ngood woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate\\r\\npeople, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find fault\\r\\nwith. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did\\r\\nask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he\\r\\nwanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he\\r\\nwas such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under\\r\\nblankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins\\r\\nput for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”[157]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were\\r\\nmeeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for\\r\\nhis two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and said, “Come, wake\\r\\nup; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the\\r\\ndust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a\\r\\nwet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water from the\\r\\nfountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\\r\\nfor it is a feast day.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to\\r\\nthe fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the\\r\\nhouse. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began\\r\\nchopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the\\r\\nswineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he\\r\\nlet feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\\r\\n“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent\\r\\nas ever?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with which they\\r\\ndeal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense of shame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too\\r\\nwas bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two\\r\\nshepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\\r\\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here, stranger,” said he,\\r\\n“to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You\\r\\nand I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a\\r\\ntaste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts\\r\\nelsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man,\\r\\nPhiloetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats.\\r\\nThese were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when\\r\\nany one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under\\r\\nthe gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he,\\r\\n“is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his\\r\\nfamily? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\\r\\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so\\r\\npleases them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand; “Good\\r\\nday to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very poorly off now, but\\r\\nI hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove, of all gods you are\\r\\nthe most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all\\r\\nour misery and afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my\\r\\neyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about\\r\\nin just such rags as this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If\\r\\nhe is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\\r\\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and\\r\\nnow his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\\r\\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\\r\\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though he is in\\r\\nthe house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide\\r\\nUlysses’ property among them because he has been away so long. I have often\\r\\nthought—only it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with\\r\\nthe cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\\r\\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My position is\\r\\nintolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the\\r\\nprotection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet\\r\\nreturn, and send all these suitors flying out of the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and\\r\\nI can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will\\r\\nconfirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that\\r\\nhearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave\\r\\nthis place, and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who\\r\\nare now masters here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should see how\\r\\nI would do my very utmost to help him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder\\r\\nTelemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an eagle with a dove\\r\\nin its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends, this plot of ours to\\r\\nmurder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches\\r\\nand seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the\\r\\ninward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine in the\\r\\nmixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed\\r\\nround the bread in the bread baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their\\r\\nwine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was\\r\\npaved with stone;[158] he gave him a shabby looking seat\\r\\nat a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\r\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your wine\\r\\namong the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the\\r\\nsuitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed\\r\\nfrom him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to\\r\\nyourselves, or there will be mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then\\r\\nAntinous said, “We do not like such language but we will put up with it, for\\r\\nTelemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had let us we should have\\r\\nput a stop to his brave talk ere now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were\\r\\nbringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under\\r\\nthe shady grove of Apollo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his\\r\\nportion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at table gave\\r\\nUlysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told\\r\\nthem to do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for\\r\\nshe wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now there happened\\r\\nto be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from\\r\\nSame. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of\\r\\nUlysses, and said to the suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has\\r\\nalready had as large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not\\r\\nright nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\\r\\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have something\\r\\nto give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses’ servants.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their skill with\\r\\nthe bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of\\r\\nbringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store-room key,\\r\\nwhich was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her\\r\\nmaidens into the store-room at the end of the house, where her husband’s\\r\\ntreasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his\\r\\nbow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend\\r\\nwhom he had met in Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with\\r\\none another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\r\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\r\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away\\r\\nwith them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long\\r\\njourney while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent\\r\\nhim on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get\\r\\nback twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running\\r\\nwith them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to\\r\\nthe house of Jove’s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of\\r\\nvalour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he\\r\\nfeared not heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\\r\\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\r\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the\\r\\nbow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had\\r\\nbeen left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear,\\r\\nand this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at\\r\\none another’s houses, for Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do\\r\\nso. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by\\r\\nUlysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home,\\r\\nbut had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the carpenter\\r\\nhad planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite\\r\\nstraight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed\\r\\nthe strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight\\r\\nhome to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;[161] these flew open with a noise like a\\r\\nbull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform,\\r\\nwhere the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along\\r\\nwith fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case\\r\\nfrom the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping\\r\\nbitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved\\r\\nher, she went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the\\r\\nquiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came\\r\\nher maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her\\r\\nhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of\\r\\nthe bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before\\r\\nher face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house\\r\\nbecause its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you\\r\\nwant to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I\\r\\nwill bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it\\r\\nmost easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I\\r\\nfollow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in\\r\\nwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the\\r\\nsuitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by,\\r\\nthe stockman wept also when he saw his master’s bow, but Antinous scolded them.\\r\\n“You country louts,” said he, “silly simpletons; why should you add to the\\r\\nsorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in\\r\\nthe loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence,\\r\\nor go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\\r\\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light\\r\\nmatter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\r\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was\\r\\nthen only a child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string\\r\\nthe bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that\\r\\nshould taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring\\r\\nin his own house—egging the others on to do so also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have robbed me\\r\\nof my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this\\r\\nhouse and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there\\r\\nwere nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let\\r\\nit go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos,\\r\\nor Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I\\r\\ndo; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\\r\\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too\\r\\nwill make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I\\r\\nshall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win\\r\\nthe prizes which my father won before me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took\\r\\nhis sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove\\r\\nwhich he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.[162] Then he\\r\\nstamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw\\r\\nhim set them up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind\\r\\nbefore. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice\\r\\ndid he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he\\r\\nhad to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the\\r\\niron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not\\r\\nUlysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young,\\r\\nand have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if\\r\\nany one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial\\r\\nof the bow and get this contest settled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into\\r\\nthe house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down\\r\\non the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at\\r\\nwhich the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He was\\r\\nsacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl.\\r\\n[163] He was the\\r\\nonly man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others. He was\\r\\nnow the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make\\r\\nhis trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused\\r\\nto hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My\\r\\nfriends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life\\r\\nand soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\r\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has\\r\\nbrought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that\\r\\nhe may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo\\r\\nand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\\r\\nmakes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,[164] with the arrow\\r\\nstanding against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat\\r\\nfrom which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable;\\r\\nit makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many\\r\\na chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were\\r\\nnot born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in the\\r\\ncourt, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large\\r\\nball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease\\r\\nit—we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He\\r\\nalso brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the\\r\\nsuitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them\\r\\nnearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous\\r\\nand Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the\\r\\nforemost among them all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses\\r\\nsaid to them quietly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt\\r\\nwhether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you\\r\\nbe to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?\\r\\nSay which you are disposed to do—to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so ordain\\r\\nit. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might\\r\\nand main I would fight for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when,\\r\\ntherefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said, “It is I,\\r\\nUlysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year,\\r\\nI am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants\\r\\nare glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying\\r\\nfor my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be.\\r\\nIf heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\\r\\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\r\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you\\r\\nconvincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar\\r\\nfrom the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mt. Parnassus\\r\\nwith the sons of Autolycus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had\\r\\nexamined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms\\r\\nround him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands\\r\\nand faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if\\r\\nUlysses had not checked them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell\\r\\nthose who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I\\r\\nwill go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this moreover be the token\\r\\nbetween us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of\\r\\nthe bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you\\r\\nare carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their\\r\\napartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at\\r\\ntheir work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and to bind them securely at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he\\r\\nhad left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by\\r\\nthe fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He\\r\\nheaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve that\\r\\nI shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about\\r\\nthis, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel\\r\\nmost is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot\\r\\nstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it yourself.\\r\\nToday is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on\\r\\nsuch a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes they can stay where they\\r\\nare, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the\\r\\ncupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop\\r\\nthis matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats\\r\\ntomorrow—the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\\r\\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the\\r\\nhands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water\\r\\nand handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they\\r\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses\\r\\ncraftily said:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded.\\r\\nI appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken\\r\\nwith so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the\\r\\ngods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the\\r\\nmoment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among\\r\\nyou all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or\\r\\nwhether travel and neglect have made an end of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\r\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you have\\r\\nnot so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself\\r\\nlucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any\\r\\nsmaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to\\r\\nhear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear\\r\\nwhat we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as\\r\\nit does with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the\\r\\nCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When\\r\\nthe wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\\r\\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed\\r\\nat him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the\\r\\ndoorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his\\r\\ncrime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between\\r\\nmankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own\\r\\ndrunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if\\r\\nyou string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at\\r\\nonce ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you\\r\\nwill never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a\\r\\nquarrel with men younger than yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that you\\r\\nshould ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. If the\\r\\nstranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can\\r\\nyou suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the\\r\\nman himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that\\r\\ndisturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man will\\r\\ntake you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the\\r\\nbaser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say,\\r\\n‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave\\r\\nman whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who\\r\\ncame to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This\\r\\nis what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the estate of\\r\\na great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think\\r\\nwell of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This\\r\\nstranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth.\\r\\nGive him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\\r\\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and\\r\\nrobbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\r\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the\\r\\nislands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the\\r\\nbow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even\\r\\nthough I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him\\r\\ntake it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This\\r\\nbow is a man’s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the\\r\\nsuitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said,\\r\\n“You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If\\r\\nApollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get\\r\\nyou into some quiet little place, and worry you to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down\\r\\nthen and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the\\r\\ncloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in\\r\\nspite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the\\r\\ncountry, for I am the better man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than\\r\\nall the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of\\r\\nthem off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a\\r\\nbetter humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in\\r\\nthe hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea apart and said\\r\\nto her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women’s\\r\\napartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are\\r\\nat their work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s apartments.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer\\r\\ncourt. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he\\r\\nmade the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he\\r\\nhad left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands,\\r\\nand was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the\\r\\nworms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one\\r\\nturn towards his neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\\r\\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\r\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is\\r\\nlikely to be in stringing this bow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as\\r\\neasily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted\\r\\ngut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string,\\r\\nand it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The\\r\\nsuitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment,\\r\\nmoreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as\\r\\nhe heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\\r\\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage\\r\\nto Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our\\r\\ndestruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the\\r\\nswineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were\\r\\nsome miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him,\\r\\nnot even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him.\\r\\nHe endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\\r\\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and\\r\\nTelemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\\r\\nbehind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of\\r\\niron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of\\r\\nour end, for not one of us could string the bow—nor nearly do so. When it was\\r\\nabout to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should\\r\\nnot be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his\\r\\nhaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his\\r\\narrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured\\r\\nhis arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous,\\r\\nand then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\\r\\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them,\\r\\nfor they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there\\r\\nwas a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the\\r\\nground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and\\r\\nour bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends\\r\\nat home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and\\r\\nwash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\\r\\noffices due to the departed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you are\\r\\nindeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of\\r\\nunderstanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of\\r\\nIcarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals\\r\\nshall compose a song that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the\\r\\nconstancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of\\r\\nTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\\r\\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the\\r\\nearth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town and soon reached\\r\\nthe fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with infinite\\r\\nlabour. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the\\r\\nslaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there\\r\\nwas an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When\\r\\nUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile\\r\\nI want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognise me after so\\r\\nlong an absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went\\r\\nstraight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial\\r\\nof his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolius,\\r\\nnor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering\\r\\nthorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had\\r\\ntold them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a\\r\\ndirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs\\r\\nof oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather;\\r\\nhe had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When\\r\\nUlysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall\\r\\npear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and\\r\\ntell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question\\r\\nhim and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with\\r\\nhim, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging\\r\\nabout a plant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener—what pains you\\r\\ntake with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine,\\r\\nolive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust,\\r\\nhowever, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of\\r\\nyour garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It\\r\\ncannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,\\r\\nindeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\\r\\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should\\r\\nwash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but\\r\\ntell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\\r\\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have come to\\r\\nreally Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and\\r\\nhad not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old\\r\\nfriend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\\r\\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once\\r\\nwhen I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I\\r\\nliked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was\\r\\nLaertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all\\r\\nthe abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\\r\\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with\\r\\nflowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of\\r\\ntapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve\\r\\nfair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good\\r\\nlooking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nHis father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the country\\r\\nthat you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked people. All this\\r\\nwealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have found your\\r\\nfriend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would\\r\\nhave requited your presents amply when you left him—as would have been only\\r\\nright considering what you had already given him. But tell me, and tell me\\r\\ntrue, how many years is it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as\\r\\never was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea\\r\\nhave eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\\r\\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could\\r\\nthrow our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent\\r\\nand richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his\\r\\ndeath bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But\\r\\nnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you—tell me of your\\r\\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to\\r\\nIthaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought\\r\\nyou here have gone on their way and left you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come from\\r\\nAlybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who is the son of\\r\\nPolypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I was\\r\\nleaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my will. As for my ship\\r\\nit is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the\\r\\nfifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good\\r\\nfor him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and\\r\\nI rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have\\r\\nanother friendly meeting and exchange presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands\\r\\nwith the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey head, groaning\\r\\nheavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils\\r\\nquivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his\\r\\narms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he, father, about whom you are\\r\\nasking—I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But cease your\\r\\nsighing and lamentation—we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I\\r\\nhave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence\\r\\nand crimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come back again,\\r\\nyou must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall convince me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s tusk\\r\\nwhen I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to\\r\\nAutolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he was over\\r\\nhere he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees\\r\\nin the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed\\r\\nyou round the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and\\r\\nwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\\r\\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn\\r\\nplanted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of\\r\\nheaven has been laid heavy upon them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son\\r\\nhad given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or\\r\\nhe would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and was\\r\\nbeginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father Jove, then you gods are\\r\\nstill in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their\\r\\ninsolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the\\r\\ntownspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers\\r\\neverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let\\r\\nus go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told Telemachus,\\r\\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as\\r\\npossible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there\\r\\nthey found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and\\r\\nmixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed\\r\\nhim and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up\\r\\nto him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter\\r\\nthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\\r\\nan immortal, and said to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been\\r\\nmaking you much taller and better-looking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the\\r\\nman I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took Nericum, that strong\\r\\nfortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had been in our\\r\\nhouse yesterday with my armour on, I should have been able to stand by you and\\r\\nhelp you against the suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and\\r\\nyou would have rejoiced to see it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and\\r\\nthe feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper place on the\\r\\nbenches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolius and his sons\\r\\nleft their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after\\r\\nLaertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw\\r\\nUlysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but\\r\\nUlysses scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old\\r\\nman, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some\\r\\ntime and have been waiting for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said he,\\r\\nseizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have long been\\r\\nwishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up\\r\\nhoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.[187] But tell me,\\r\\ndoes Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not trouble about\\r\\nthat.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses\\r\\nto give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took their\\r\\nseats in due order near Dolius their father.\"\n",

BIAGIO INGROIA,\\r\\nPREZIOSO ALLEATO\\r\\nL’AUTORE RICONOSCENTE.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\\n\\r\\nThis translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The Authoress of\\r\\nthe Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give the whole “Odyssey”\\r\\nin that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore epitomised my translation,\\r\\nwhich was already completed and which I now publish in full.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\\r\\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I have\\r\\nthere written. The points in question are:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely from, the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike as regards the\\r\\nPhaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of Ulysses, when once he is\\r\\nwithin easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves into a periplus of the island,\\r\\npractically from Trapani back to Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits\\r\\nof Messina, and the island of Pantellaria.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman, who lived at the\\r\\nplace now called Trapani, and introduced herself into her work under the name\\r\\nof Nausicaa.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\\r\\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English and\\r\\nItalian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the “Athenaeum”\\r\\nfor January 30 and February 20, 1892. Both contentions were urged (also without\\r\\nrejoinder) in the Johnian “Eagle” for the Lent and October terms of the same\\r\\nyear. Nothing to which I should reply has reached me from any quarter, and\\r\\nknowing how anxiously I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in\\r\\nmy argument, I begin to feel some confidence that, did such flaws exist, I\\r\\nshould have heard, at any rate about some of them, before now. Without,\\r\\ntherefore, for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce\\r\\nin my conclusions, I shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me\\r\\nas that it will be incumbent upon me to reply, and shall confine myself to\\r\\ntranslating the “Odyssey” for English readers, with such notes as I think will\\r\\nbe found useful. Among these I would especially call attention to one on xxii.\\r\\n465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe has kindly allowed me to make public.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nI have repeated several of the illustrations used in “The Authoress of the\\r\\nOdyssey”, and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court of Ulysses’\\r\\nhouse more vividly before the reader. I should like to explain that the\\r\\npresence of a man and a dog in one illustration is accidental, and was not\\r\\nobserved by me till I developed the negative. In an appendix I have also\\r\\nreprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the plan of Ulysses’ house, together\\r\\nwith the plan itself. The reader is recommended to study this plan with some\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the preface to my translation of the “Iliad” I have given my views as to the\\r\\nmain principles by which a translator should be guided, and need not repeat\\r\\nthem here, beyond pointing out that the initial liberty of translating poetry\\r\\ninto prose involves the continual taking of more or less liberty throughout the\\r\\ntranslation; for much that is right in poetry is wrong in prose, and the\\r\\nexigencies of readable prose are the first things to be considered in a prose\\r\\ntranslation. That the reader, however, may see how far I have departed from\\r\\nstrict construe, I will print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang’s translation of\\r\\nthe sixty lines or so of the “Odyssey.” Their translation runs:\\n---------new doc---------\\nAnd Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I\\r\\nam Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here\\r\\nwith my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for\\r\\nTemesa[4] with a\\r\\ncargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over\\r\\nyonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron[5] under the wooded\\r\\nmountain Neritum.[6]\\r\\nOur fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will\\r\\ngo and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives\\r\\nby himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him\\r\\nand get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his\\r\\nvineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came,\\r\\nbut it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\\r\\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or\\r\\na prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\r\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon\\r\\nme from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is\\r\\na man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find\\r\\nsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses\\r\\nreally have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully\\r\\nlike him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail\\r\\nfor Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have\\r\\nnever either of us seen the other.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother,” answered Telemachus, “tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a\\r\\nwise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had\\r\\ngrown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more\\r\\nill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Minerva said, “There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope\\r\\nhas such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the\\r\\nmeaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?\\r\\nHave you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family—for no one seems to\\r\\nbe bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests—how atrociously they are\\r\\nbehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any\\r\\nrespectable person who comes near them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” said Telemachus, “as regards your question, so long as my father was\\r\\nhere it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure\\r\\nhave willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man\\r\\nwas ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if\\r\\nhe had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him\\r\\nwhen the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built\\r\\na mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but\\r\\nnow the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\r\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but\\r\\ndismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father;\\r\\nheaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all\\r\\nour islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all\\r\\nthe principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of\\r\\npaying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will\\r\\nnot marry,[7] nor yet\\r\\nbring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long\\r\\nwill do so also with myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is that so?” exclaimed Minerva, “then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.\\r\\nGive him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is the man he\\r\\nwas when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would\\r\\nsoon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more\\r\\nupon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to\\r\\nbeg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the\\r\\never-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some,\\r\\nfor he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors\\r\\nwill have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take\\r\\nhis revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about\\r\\ntrying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean\\r\\nheroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your case before them, and call heaven\\r\\nto bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own\\r\\nplace, and if your mother’s mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to\\r\\nher father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage\\r\\ngifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\\r\\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in\\r\\nquest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you\\r\\nsomething, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent\\r\\nmessage may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to\\r\\nSparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you\\r\\nhear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the\\r\\nwaste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other\\r\\nhand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\\r\\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again.\\r\\nThen, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means\\r\\nor foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\r\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes’ praises\\r\\nfor having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart\\r\\nlooking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now,\\r\\nhowever, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I\\r\\nkeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what\\r\\nI have said to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this\\r\\nway, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you\\r\\nwant to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have\\r\\ntaken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you\\r\\nshall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value—a\\r\\nkeepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMinerva answered, “Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As\\r\\nfor any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and\\r\\nI will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give\\r\\nyou one of no less value in return.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given\\r\\nTelemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He\\r\\nfelt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so\\r\\nhe went straight to where the suitors were sitting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the\\r\\nsad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the\\r\\nAchaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs,\\r\\nand came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her\\r\\nhandmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts\\r\\nthat supported the roof of the cloisters[8] with a staid maiden on either side of\\r\\nher. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Phemius,” she cried, “you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as\\r\\npoets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink\\r\\ntheir wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful\\r\\nheart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and\\r\\nwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.”[9]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mother,” answered Telemachus, “let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards\\r\\ndo not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and\\r\\nwho sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This\\r\\nfellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people\\r\\nalways applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear\\r\\nit; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another\\r\\nwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for\\r\\nspeech is man’s matter, and mine above all others [10]—for it is I who am master here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were\\r\\nclamorous throughout the covered cloisters[11], and prayed each one that he might be\\r\\nher bed fellow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke, “Shameless,” he cried, “and insolent suitors, let us\\r\\nfeast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing\\r\\nto hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet\\r\\nme in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at\\r\\none another’s houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other\\r\\nhand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove\\r\\nshall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father’s house there\\r\\nshall be no man to avenge you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of\\r\\nhis speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, “The gods seem to have\\r\\ngiven you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be\\r\\nchief in Ithaca as your father was before you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus answered, “Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will\\r\\nbe chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no\\r\\nbad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that\\r\\nUlysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some\\r\\nother may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own\\r\\nhouse, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, “It rests with heaven to decide who\\r\\nshall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over\\r\\nyour own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you\\r\\nviolence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this\\r\\nstranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is\\r\\nhis estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he\\r\\non business of his own? He seemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so\\r\\nsuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My father is dead and gone,” answered Telemachus, “and even if some rumour\\r\\nreaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send\\r\\nfor a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for\\r\\nthe stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old\\r\\nfriend of my father’s.” But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but\\r\\nwhen night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own\\r\\nabode.[12]\\r\\nTelemachus’s room was high up in a tower[13] that looked on to the outer court;\\r\\nhither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman,\\r\\nEuryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of\\r\\nblazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite\\r\\nyoung; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to\\r\\nher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her\\r\\nto his bed for he feared his wife’s resentment.[14] She it was who now lighted Telemachus\\r\\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house\\r\\ndid, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed\\r\\nroom and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt[15] he gave it to the good old woman, who\\r\\nfolded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\r\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt\\r\\nhome by means of the strap.[16] But Telemachus as he lay covered with\\r\\na woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of\\r\\nthe counsel that Minerva had given him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK II\\n\\r\\nASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE\\r\\nSUITORS—TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH MINERVA\\r\\nDISGUISED AS MENTOR.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus rose and\\r\\ndressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword\\r\\nabout his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once\\r\\nsent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and\\r\\nthe people gathered thereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the\\r\\nplace of assembly spear in hand—not alone, for his two hounds went with him.\\r\\nMinerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all\\r\\nmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father’s seat\\r\\neven the oldest councillors made way for him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Mentor,” answered Telemachus, “do not let us talk about it any more. There is\\r\\nno chance of my father’s ever coming back; the gods have long since counselled\\r\\nhis destruction. There is something else, however, about which I should like to\\r\\nask Nestor, for he knows much more than any one else does. They say he has\\r\\nreigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell\\r\\nme, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that\\r\\nway? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far\\r\\nbetter a man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\\r\\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you truly,” answered Nestor, “and indeed you have yourself divined\\r\\nhow it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had found Aegisthus\\r\\nstill alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him,\\r\\nnot even when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to\\r\\ndogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a\\r\\ndeed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and\\r\\nAegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled\\r\\nAgamemnon’s wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a\\r\\ngood natural disposition;[30] moreover there was a bard with her,\\r\\nto whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was\\r\\nto keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction,\\r\\nAegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows\\r\\nand seagulls to batten upon—after which she went willingly enough to the house\\r\\nof Aegisthus. Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated\\r\\nmany temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his\\r\\nexpectations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with\\r\\none another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with\\r\\nhis painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus’ ship (and never\\r\\nman knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then\\r\\nand there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press\\r\\nforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\\r\\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far\\r\\nas the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard\\r\\ntill the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one\\r\\nhalf towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the\\r\\nriver Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea\\r\\nfrom a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as\\r\\nPhaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after\\r\\nPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\\r\\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked;\\r\\nbut the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships,\\r\\nthey were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold\\r\\nand substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home\\r\\nplotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled\\r\\nin Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year\\r\\nOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\\r\\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false\\r\\nAegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus\\r\\ncame home,[31] with\\r\\nas much treasure as his ships could carry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far from home,\\r\\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat\\r\\nup everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool’s errand.\\r\\nStill, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has\\r\\nlately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope\\r\\nto get back from, when the winds had once carried him so far out of his\\r\\nreckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, so vast and\\r\\nterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and\\r\\ntake your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have\\r\\na chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to\\r\\nLacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will\\r\\ntell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, “Sir, all\\r\\nthat you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to\\r\\nbe cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune, and the other\\r\\nimmortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time. People should go away early\\r\\nand not keep late hours at a religious festival.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\\r\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\\r\\nwith wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink\\r\\noffering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood\\r\\nup to make their drink offerings. When they had made their offerings and had\\r\\ndrunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on\\r\\nboard their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Heaven and the immortal gods,” he exclaimed, “forbid that you should leave my\\r\\nhouse to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes,\\r\\nor that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both\\r\\nfor myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of rugs and\\r\\ncloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on\\r\\nthe deck of a ship—not while I live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they\\r\\nwill keep open house as I have done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Minerva answered, “Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better\\r\\nthat Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with\\r\\nyou and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and\\r\\nkeep them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest are\\r\\nall young men of Telemachus’ own age, who have taken this voyage out of\\r\\nfriendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I\\r\\nmust go to the Cauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me.\\r\\nAs for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a\\r\\nchariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him\\r\\nwith your best and fleetest horses.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nthey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to the\\r\\nabode of Menelaus[36] [and found him in his own house,\\r\\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son, and also\\r\\nof his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior\\r\\nAchilles. He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still\\r\\nat Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending\\r\\nher with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles’\\r\\nson was reigning. For his only son he had found a bride from Sparta,[37] the daughter of\\r\\nAlector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\\r\\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as\\r\\ngolden Venus herself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his\\r\\nhouse. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\\r\\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with\\r\\nhis tune.[38]\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate, whereon\\r\\nEteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying\\r\\nback into the house to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said,\\r\\n“Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of\\r\\nJove. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find\\r\\nfriends elsewhere as they best can?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was very angry and said, “Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never used to\\r\\nbe a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course,\\r\\nand show the strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have staid often\\r\\nenough at other people’s houses before we got back here, where heaven grant\\r\\nthat we may rest in peace henceforward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him. They took\\r\\ntheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and\\r\\ngave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against\\r\\nthe end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus were astonished when they saw it, for its splendour was as that of\\r\\nthe sun and moon; then, when they had admired everything to their heart’s\\r\\ncontent, they went into the bath room and washed themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them\\r\\nwoollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of\\r\\nMenelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and\\r\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a\\r\\nclean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them\\r\\nmany good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them\\r\\nplates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, “Fall to, and welcome; when you have done\\r\\nsupper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have\\r\\nbeen lost. You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor\\r\\npeople do not have such sons as you are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he handed them[39] a piece of fat roast loin, which had\\r\\nbeen set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\\r\\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\r\\nTelemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might\\r\\nhear, “Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and\\r\\ngold—of amber,[40]\\r\\nivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace\\r\\nof Olympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus overheard him and said, “No one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove,\\r\\nfor his house and everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men—well,\\r\\nthere may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not; but at\\r\\nall events I have travelled much and have undergone much hardship, for it was\\r\\nnearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus,\\r\\nPhoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and\\r\\nthe Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are\\r\\nborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\\r\\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the ewes\\r\\nyield all the year round. But while I was travelling and getting great riches\\r\\namong these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the\\r\\nperfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all\\r\\nthis wealth. Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all\\r\\nthis, and of my heavy loss in the ruin[41] of a stately mansion fully and\\r\\nmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so\\r\\nthat I had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the plain\\r\\nof Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and\\r\\nall of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again,\\r\\nfor crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I\\r\\nmay, I do so for one man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him\\r\\nwithout loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one\\r\\nof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing\\r\\nby it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long\\r\\ntime, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his\\r\\nlong-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him\\r\\nan infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of\\r\\nhis father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he\\r\\nheld his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus saw this he\\r\\ndoubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at\\r\\nonce and find what it was all about.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted and\\r\\nperfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought her a seat,\\r\\nAlcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which\\r\\nAlcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which\\r\\nis the richest city in the whole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of\\r\\npure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife\\r\\ngave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work\\r\\nbox that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\\r\\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet\\r\\ncoloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her\\r\\nfeet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband.[42]\\n---------new doc---------\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, “You gods,” she exclaimed,\\r\\n“ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a\\r\\ngoddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So\\r\\nwhen rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you\\r\\nfurious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in\\r\\nlove with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove\\r\\ncame to hear of it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts.\\r\\nAnd now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor\\r\\ncreature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with\\r\\nlightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\\r\\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and\\r\\ncherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should\\r\\nnever grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels\\r\\nto nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas\\r\\nagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men\\r\\nwho can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good\\r\\nfaith, as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then send him away,” said Mercury, “or Jove will be angry with you and punish\\r\\nyou”.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for she\\r\\nhad heard Jove’s message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes\\r\\never filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired\\r\\nof Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it\\r\\nwas she, not he, that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the\\r\\nrocks and on the sea shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always\\r\\nlooking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out\\r\\nany longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some\\r\\nbeams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may\\r\\ncarry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to\\r\\nsave you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send you a fair\\r\\nwind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it—for they know more\\r\\nabout these things, and can settle them better than I can.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. “Now goddess,” he answered, “there is\\r\\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when\\r\\nyou bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well\\r\\nfound ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing\\r\\nthat you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first\\r\\nsolemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: “You know a great deal,”\\r\\nsaid she, “but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my\\r\\nwitnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this is the most solemn oath\\r\\nwhich a blessed god can take—that I mean you no sort of harm, and am only\\r\\nadvising you to do exactly what I should do myself in your place. I am dealing\\r\\nwith you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very\\r\\nsorry for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they\\r\\ncame to Calypso’s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury had just left.\\r\\nCalypso set meat and drink before him of the food that mortals eat; but her\\r\\nmaids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and they laid their hands on the\\r\\ngood things that were before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat\\r\\nand drink, Calypso spoke, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own land at\\r\\nonce? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much suffering is\\r\\nin store for you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where\\r\\nyou are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no matter how\\r\\nanxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the\\r\\ntime day after day; yet I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or\\r\\nwell-looking than she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman\\r\\nshould compare in beauty with an immortal.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” replied Ulysses, “do not be angry with me about this. I am quite\\r\\naware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as\\r\\nyourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I\\r\\nwant to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I\\r\\nam on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had infinite\\r\\ntrouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with the rest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into the\\r\\ninner part of the cave and went to bed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on his shirt\\r\\nand cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine\\r\\nand graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to\\r\\ncover her head. She at once set herself to think how she could speed Ulysses on\\r\\nhis way. So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was\\r\\nsharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on\\r\\nto it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\\r\\nthe island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached\\r\\nthe sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water.[53] Then, when she\\r\\nhad shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\\r\\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed\\r\\nthem smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\\r\\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the\\r\\ntimbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\\r\\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the\\r\\nribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and\\r\\na rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\\r\\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and\\r\\nby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too,\\r\\nexcellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the\\r\\nhelp of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he should\\r\\nhave his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made\\r\\ntheir drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went\\r\\nhome to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Ulysses in the cloister with\\r\\nArete and Alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper.\\r\\nArete was the first to speak, for she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good\\r\\nclothes that Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so\\r\\nshe said, “Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\\r\\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\r\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Ulysses answered, “It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate in full\\r\\nthe tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me;\\r\\nbut as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea which is\\r\\ncalled ‘the Ogygian.’ Here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso,\\r\\ndaughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or\\r\\ndivine. Fortune, however, brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for\\r\\nJove struck my ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My\\r\\nbrave comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was\\r\\ncarried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\r\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the\\r\\ngreat goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost\\r\\nkindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old,\\r\\nbut she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\r\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last when the\\r\\neighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because\\r\\nJove had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind. She sent me\\r\\nfrom her island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and\\r\\nwine. Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew\\r\\nboth warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the\\r\\neighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your\\r\\ncoast—and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still\\r\\nmuch trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no\\r\\nfurther, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that\\r\\nI could no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the\\r\\ngale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the waves\\r\\ndashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came\\r\\nto a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks\\r\\nand it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the water and\\r\\ngathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so I left the river,\\r\\nand went into a thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and\\r\\npresently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I\\r\\nslept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when\\r\\nI woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter’s maid servants playing\\r\\nupon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\r\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than\\r\\ncould be expected from so young a person—for young people are apt to be\\r\\nthoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had had me\\r\\nwashed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me. Now,\\r\\ntherefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Alcinous said, “Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring\\r\\nyou on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she was the first\\r\\nperson whose aid you asked.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pray do not scold her,” replied Ulysses; “she is not to blame. She did tell me\\r\\nto follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you\\r\\nmight perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a\\r\\nlittle suspicious and irritable.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stranger,” replied Alcinous, “I am not the kind of man to get angry about\\r\\nnothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove, Minerva, and\\r\\nApollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I\\r\\ndo, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my son-in-law. If\\r\\nyou will stay I will give you a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid)\\r\\nshall keep you here against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I\\r\\nwill attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep[64] during the whole\\r\\nvoyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to\\r\\nyour own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further off\\r\\nthan Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow-haired\\r\\nRhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any\\r\\nplace—and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing\\r\\nthemselves, and came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\\r\\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, “Father Jove, grant that\\r\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable name\\r\\namong mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that\\r\\nwas in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets\\r\\non the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon\\r\\nwent out with torches in their hands, and when they had made the bed they came\\r\\nup to Ulysses and said, “Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is\\r\\nready,” and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\r\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by his\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\r\\nBANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous and\\r\\nUlysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly,\\r\\nwhich was near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a\\r\\nseat of polished stone, while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous’\\r\\nservants, and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She\\r\\nwent up to the citizens, man by man, and said, “Aldermen and town councillors\\r\\nof the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger\\r\\nwho has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\\r\\nlike an immortal god.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the\\r\\nassembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck\\r\\nwith the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head\\r\\nand shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he\\r\\nmight impress the Phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man, and\\r\\nmight come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge\\r\\nhim. Then, when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hear me,” said he, “aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I\\r\\nmay speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his\\r\\nway to my house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort\\r\\nand wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we\\r\\nhave done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house\\r\\nhas been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us\\r\\ndraw a ship into the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with\\r\\ntwo and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your\\r\\noars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a\\r\\nfeast.[65] I will\\r\\nfind you in everything. I am giving these instructions to the young men who\\r\\nwill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\\r\\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses, and\\r\\nwe will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he\\r\\nmay choose to sing about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a servant went\\r\\nto fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they\\r\\nhad been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got\\r\\nher mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\\r\\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They\\r\\nmoored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went\\r\\nto the house of King Alcinous. The out houses,[66] yards, and all the precincts were\\r\\nfilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alcinous\\r\\nkilled them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen. These they\\r\\nskinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly\\r\\nloved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed\\r\\nhim with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous\\r\\nset a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He\\r\\nhung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to\\r\\nfeel for it with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals\\r\\nby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so\\r\\ndisposed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,\\r\\nbut as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired\\r\\nDemodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was\\r\\nthen in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and\\r\\nAchilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat\\r\\ntogether at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains\\r\\nquarrelling with one another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he\\r\\ncrossed the stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the\\r\\nevil that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and\\r\\ncovered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was\\r\\nweeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\\r\\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but\\r\\nwhen the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in\\r\\nhis lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.\\r\\nNo one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\\r\\nheard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and\\r\\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast,\\r\\nand of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\\r\\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to\\r\\ntell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers,\\r\\njumpers, and runners.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A servant hung\\r\\nDemodocus’s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him\\r\\non the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were\\r\\ngoing to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them,\\r\\nand there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos,\\r\\nOcyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus,\\r\\nThoon, Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also\\r\\nEuryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\\r\\nman among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\\r\\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the starting\\r\\npost, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the\\r\\nsame moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else\\r\\nbehind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a\\r\\nfallow field.[67]\\r\\nThey then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to\\r\\nbe the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at\\r\\nthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous’s son\\r\\nLaodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had\\r\\nall been diverted with the games, “Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in\\r\\nany of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs, calves, hands,\\r\\nand neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered\\r\\nmuch lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no\\r\\nmatter how strong he is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are quite right, Laodamas,” replied Euryalus, “go up to your guest and\\r\\nspeak to him about it yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said\\r\\nto Ulysses, “I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of\\r\\nour competitions if you are skilled in any of them—and you must have gone in\\r\\nfor many a one before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit\\r\\nall his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet.\\r\\nHave a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your\\r\\nreturn home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the\\r\\nwater, and the crew is found.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind is set\\r\\nrather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite trouble, and am\\r\\ncome among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me\\r\\non my return home.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“When they reached Circe’s house they found it built of cut stones, on a site\\r\\nthat could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild\\r\\nmountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor bewitched creatures whom\\r\\nshe had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection. They did not\\r\\nattack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their\\r\\nnoses lovingly against them.[86] As hounds crowd round their master\\r\\nwhen they see him coming from dinner—for they know he will bring them\\r\\nsomething—even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon\\r\\nmy men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.\\r\\nPresently they reached the gates of the goddess’s house, and as they stood\\r\\nthere they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked at\\r\\nher loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours as no one\\r\\nbut a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than\\r\\nany other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working at a loom and\\r\\nsinging most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and\\r\\nsee whether she is woman or goddess.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter.\\r\\nThey, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected\\r\\nmischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them\\r\\nupon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and\\r\\nPramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their\\r\\nhomes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her\\r\\nwand, and shut them up in her pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and\\r\\nall, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as\\r\\nbefore, and they remembered everything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and\\r\\nbeech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the\\r\\nsad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried\\r\\nto speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears and he\\r\\ncould only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he\\r\\ntold us what had happened to the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of\\r\\nit there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen\\r\\nfrom far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her\\r\\nloom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she\\r\\nat once came down, opened the door, and invited us in. The others did not\\r\\nsuspect any mischief so they followed her into the house, but I staid where I\\r\\nwas, for I thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them\\r\\nno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\\r\\nfor them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my\\r\\nbow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way. But he laid\\r\\nhold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, ‘Sir, do not force\\r\\nme to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of\\r\\nthem back with you, nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we\\r\\ncannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save\\r\\nour lives.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Stay where you are, then,’ answered I, ‘eating and drinking at the ship, but\\r\\nI must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the charmed\\r\\ngrove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury\\r\\nwith his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and\\r\\nbeauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and took my\\r\\nhand within his own, saying, ‘My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over\\r\\nthis mountain top, alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in\\r\\nCirce’s pigstyes, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\\r\\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back\\r\\nand will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will\\r\\nprotect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which is one of\\r\\ngreat virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe’s house, it will be a\\r\\ntalisman to you against every kind of mischief.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to\\r\\npractice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will drug the\\r\\nmeal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the\\r\\nvirtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working.\\r\\nI will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your\\r\\nsword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her. She will then\\r\\nbe frightened, and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not\\r\\npoint blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to\\r\\ntake good care also of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all\\r\\nthe blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else\\r\\nwhen she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it was\\r\\nlike. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call\\r\\nit Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they\\r\\nlike.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island; but I\\r\\nfared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I\\r\\nwalked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and\\r\\nas soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come\\r\\nin; so I followed her—much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly\\r\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet,\\r\\nand she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it,\\r\\nfor she meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without\\r\\nits charming me, she struck me with her wand. ‘There now,’ she cried, ‘be off\\r\\nto the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon\\r\\nshe fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying,\\r\\n‘Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you come? How can it\\r\\nbe that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man able to\\r\\nstand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must be spell-proof;\\r\\nsurely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always\\r\\nsaid would come here some day with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so\\r\\nbe it then; sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends\\r\\nand learn to trust each other.’\\n---------new doc---------\\n“‘Mother,’ said I, ‘I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the\\r\\nTheban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean land nor set\\r\\nfoot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of\\r\\nmisfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilius,\\r\\nthe land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true,\\r\\nin what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe\\r\\nyou a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the\\r\\nson whom I left behind me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one\\r\\nelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me\\r\\nagain what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with\\r\\nmy son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could\\r\\nand married again?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My mother answered, ‘Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in\\r\\ngreat distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day.\\r\\nNo one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still\\r\\nholds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of course he\\r\\nmust, considering his position as a magistrate,[92] and how every one invites him; your\\r\\nfather remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the town. He\\r\\nhas no comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in\\r\\nfront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\\r\\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine\\r\\nleaves thrown any how upon the ground. He grieves continually about your never\\r\\nhaving come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older. As for my own\\r\\nend it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my\\r\\nown house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear\\r\\npeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the\\r\\nforce of my affection for you—this it was that was the death of me.’[93]\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother’s ghost. Thrice I\\r\\nsprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time she flitted\\r\\nfrom my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick I\\r\\nsaid to her, ‘Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we\\r\\ncould throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the\\r\\nsharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay\\r\\na still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My son,’ she answered, ‘most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine\\r\\nthat is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are dead. The\\r\\nsinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these perish in the\\r\\nfierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul\\r\\nflits away as though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day\\r\\nas soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to your\\r\\nwife hereafter.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and\\r\\ndaughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood,\\r\\nand I considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed that\\r\\nit would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep\\r\\nthem from all drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other,\\r\\nand each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus\\r\\nthe son of Aeolus.[94] She fell in love with the river\\r\\nEnipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she\\r\\nwas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay\\r\\nwith her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave arched itself like a\\r\\nmountain over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin\\r\\ngirdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished the deed\\r\\nof love, he took her hand in his own and said, ‘Tyro, rejoice in all good will;\\r\\nthe embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about\\r\\nthis time twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go home,\\r\\nbut hold your tongue and do not tell any one.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who\\r\\nboth of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of\\r\\nsheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos. The rest of her\\r\\nchildren were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a\\r\\nmighty warrior and charioteer.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of having slept\\r\\nin the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethus.\\r\\nThese founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it; for\\r\\nstrong though they were they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable\\r\\nHercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon, and married the\\r\\nredoubtable son of Amphitryon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it was to\\r\\nmarry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after having killed his\\r\\nfather, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he\\r\\nremained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him;\\r\\nbut Epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged\\r\\nherself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged\\r\\nmother—to his ruing bitterly thereafter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given priceless\\r\\npresents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of\\r\\nMinyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore Nestor, Chromius, and\\r\\nPericlymenus, and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was\\r\\nwooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give her to him who\\r\\nshould raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and\\r\\nthis was a hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a\\r\\ncertain excellent seer,[95] but the will of heaven was against\\r\\nhim, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;\\r\\nnevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season came round again,\\r\\nIphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\\r\\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor\\r\\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying\\r\\nunder the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of\\r\\nJove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day\\r\\nthroughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.\\n---------new doc---------\\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles,\\r\\ntook away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she\\r\\nbleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes\\r\\nand threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer\\r\\ngarment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a\\r\\ntwisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess went\\r\\nstraight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\r\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the wooded\\r\\ncountry and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where\\r\\nMinerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty\\r\\nservant he had. He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the\\r\\nyards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made\\r\\nthem spacious[126] and fair to see, with a free run\\r\\nfor the pigs all round them; he had built them during his master’s absence, of\\r\\nstones which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to\\r\\nPenelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside\\r\\nthe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close\\r\\ntogether, while inside he had built twelve styes near one another for the sows\\r\\nto lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding\\r\\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the\\r\\nsuitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had\\r\\ncontinually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman’s\\r\\nfour hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The\\r\\nswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals[127] from a good\\r\\nstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or\\r\\nanother, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced\\r\\nto send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at him, but\\r\\nUlysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he\\r\\nhad in his hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead\\r\\nhad not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the gate\\r\\nof the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them.\\r\\nThen he said to Ulysses, “Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work\\r\\nof you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me\\r\\nquite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am\\r\\nin continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to\\r\\neat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some\\r\\ndistant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill of bread and\\r\\nwine, tell me where you come from, and all about your misfortunes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down. He\\r\\nstrewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he\\r\\nthrew the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he used to sleep by\\r\\nnight. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said “May Jove, sir,\\r\\nand the rest of the gods grant you your heart’s desire in return for the kind\\r\\nway in which you have received me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Stranger, though a still poorer man\\r\\nshould come here, it would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers\\r\\nand beggars are from Jove. You must take what you can get and be thankful, for\\r\\nservants live in fear when they have young lords for their masters; and this is\\r\\nmy misfortune now, for heaven has hindered the return of him who would have\\r\\nbeen always good to me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of\\r\\nland, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\\r\\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they\\r\\nhave mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he\\r\\nwould have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen’s\\r\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good\\r\\nman. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds,\\r\\nto fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where the young\\r\\nsucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and\\r\\nsacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted them; when the meat was\\r\\ncooked he brought it all in and set it before Ulysses, hot and still on the\\r\\nspit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd\\r\\nthen mixed wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told\\r\\nhim to begin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fall to, stranger,” said he, “on a dish of servant’s pork. The fat pigs have\\r\\nto go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed\\r\\ngods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is lawful and\\r\\nright. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on other people’s land, and\\r\\nJove gives them their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and\\r\\ngot home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but\\r\\nsome god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\r\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\r\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear or\\r\\nstint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not one\\r\\nvictim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly\\r\\nrich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he\\r\\nwas; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.\\r\\nThere are twelve herds of cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of\\r\\nsheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired\\r\\nstrangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he\\r\\nruns even large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in\\r\\nthe charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the\\r\\nbest goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs\\r\\nthat you see here, and I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending\\r\\nit to them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously without\\r\\na word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the\\r\\nswineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and\\r\\ngave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, “My\\r\\nfriend, who was this master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich\\r\\nand so powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King\\r\\nAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove\\r\\nand the other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have\\r\\ntravelled much.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the\\r\\nland of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and children\\r\\ncaptive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war\\r\\ncry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen\\r\\nand foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my\\r\\nmen, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves\\r\\nsurrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do\\r\\nforced labour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus—and I wish\\r\\nI had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store\\r\\nfor me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\r\\nI went straight up to the king’s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them,\\r\\nwhereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to\\r\\nhis own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kill me in\\r\\ntheir fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the\\r\\nprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\r\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on for\\r\\neight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already\\r\\ncommitted all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with\\r\\nhim to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a\\r\\nwhole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months and days had gone\\r\\nby till the same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\\r\\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that\\r\\nplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I\\r\\nfetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not\\r\\nhelp it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea that lies\\r\\nbetween Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their destruction, for\\r\\nas soon as we were well out from Crete and could see nothing but sea and sky,\\r\\nhe raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then\\r\\nJove let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was\\r\\nfilled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all\\r\\ninto the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like\\r\\nso many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\r\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship’s mast within my\\r\\nreach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted before the fury of\\r\\nthe gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great\\r\\nwave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the\\r\\nThesprotians entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all—for\\r\\nhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he\\r\\nraised me by the hand, took me to his father’s house and gave me clothes to\\r\\nwear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had\\r\\nentertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward\\r\\njourney. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so\\r\\nmuch had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had\\r\\ngone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the god’s high oak tree,\\r\\nand know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or\\r\\nin secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in\\r\\nhis own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew\\r\\nfound, that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\r\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be\\r\\nsure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very\\r\\nextreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land they\\r\\nresolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that\\r\\nI was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now see\\r\\nme; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there\\r\\nthey bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to\\r\\nget supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\\r\\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck\\r\\nout and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\r\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went\\r\\nsearching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further use and\\r\\nwent back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me\\r\\nto a good man’s door—for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Poor unhappy stranger, I have found\\r\\nthe story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that part about\\r\\nUlysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe it. Why should a man\\r\\nlike you go about telling lies in this way? I know all about the return of my\\r\\nmaster. The gods one and all of them detest him, or they would have taken him\\r\\nbefore Troy, or let him die with friends around him when the days of his\\r\\nfighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\r\\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm winds\\r\\nhave spirited him away we know not whither.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the town\\r\\nunless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about Ulysses.\\r\\nThen they all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the\\r\\nking’s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his\\r\\nproperty without paying for it. For my own part I have never cared about asking\\r\\nanyone else since the time when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a\\r\\nman and come a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind\\r\\nto him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting\\r\\nhis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the\\r\\nfollowing summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much\\r\\nwealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\r\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any\\r\\nsuch reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the\\r\\ngod of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you\\r\\nmy oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call\\r\\nall the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a\\r\\ncloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go; but\\r\\nif he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and tell them to\\r\\nthrow me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the\\r\\ncountry telling lies.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“And a pretty figure I should cut then,” replied Eumaeus, “both now and\\r\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing\\r\\nyou hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest if I did; but\\r\\nit is just supper time and I hope my men will come in directly, that we may\\r\\ncook something savoury for supper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs,\\r\\nwhich were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a tremendous\\r\\nsquealing they made as they were being driven into them. But Eumaeus called to\\r\\nhis men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice him for\\r\\nthis stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble\\r\\nenough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five\\r\\nyear old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not forget the gods,\\r\\nfor he was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut\\r\\nbristles from the pig’s face and throw them into the fire, praying to all the\\r\\ngods as he did so that Ulysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig\\r\\nwith a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,\\r\\nand stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it\\r\\nup, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the\\r\\nfat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut\\r\\nthe rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\r\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on\\r\\nto the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then\\r\\nstood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he\\r\\nset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did\\r\\nso; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices\\r\\ncut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much\\r\\npleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well disposed\\r\\ntowards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like\\r\\nmyself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your\\r\\nsupper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks\\r\\nright, for he can do whatever he chooses.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to\\r\\nthe immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands\\r\\nof Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius brought them their\\r\\nbread; the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the\\r\\nTaphians during his master’s absence, and had paid for him with his own money\\r\\nwithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their\\r\\nhands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough\\r\\nto eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all\\r\\nwent to bed after having made a hearty supper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It poured\\r\\nwithout ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet\\r\\nquarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the excellent care\\r\\nhe took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of\\r\\nhis men give him one. “Listen to me,” said he, “Eumaeus and the rest of you;\\r\\nwhen I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes\\r\\nme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will\\r\\nmake him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\\r\\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were still young\\r\\nand strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses\\r\\nwere the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would have it\\r\\nso. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our\\r\\narmour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\r\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell\\r\\nsmall and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\\r\\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough with\\r\\ntheir shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my cloak behind\\r\\nme, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my\\r\\nshirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had\\r\\nshifted their places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and\\r\\nhe at once gave me his ear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Ulysses,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak;\\r\\nsome god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, and I do not\\r\\nknow what to do.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following plan:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the others will hear you.’ Then he\\r\\nraised his head on his elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a\\r\\nlong way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell Agamemnon to\\r\\nsend us up more men at once.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the\\r\\nships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning.\\r\\nWould that I were still young and strong as I was in those days, for then some\\r\\none of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the\\r\\nrespect due to a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my\\r\\nclothes are shabby.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, “Old man, you have told us an excellent story, and have\\r\\nsaid nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore,\\r\\nyou shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress\\r\\nmay reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old\\r\\nrags about your body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up\\r\\nhere, but every man has only one. When Ulysses’ son comes home again he will\\r\\ngive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins and\\r\\nsheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay down, and\\r\\nEumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in\\r\\ncase of extraordinarily bad weather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the swineherd\\r\\ndid not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready to go outside, and\\r\\nUlysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master’s\\r\\nabsence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick\\r\\ncloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a large and well fed goat,\\r\\nand a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his\\r\\nrest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them\\r\\nshelter from the North wind.\\n---------new doc---------\\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then\\r\\nPisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them all as he did\\r\\nso. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the house, and they\\r\\nboth of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in a\\r\\nbeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\\r\\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them\\r\\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\\r\\nEteoneus carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes\\r\\npoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\r\\nbefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and\\r\\nPisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove\\r\\nout through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right\\r\\nhand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in\\r\\nfront of the horses and pledged them, saying, “Farewell to both of you; see\\r\\nthat you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind to me as any\\r\\nfather could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will be sure, sir,” answered Telemachus, “to tell him everything as soon as\\r\\nwe see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses returned when I get\\r\\nback to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have shown\\r\\nme and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a great\\r\\nwhite goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm yard—and all\\r\\nthe men and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up to\\r\\nthem and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses. When they saw\\r\\nit they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon\\r\\nPisistratus said, “Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make, but\\r\\nHelen was too quick for him and said, “I will read this matter as heaven has\\r\\nput it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle\\r\\ncame from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like manner\\r\\nUlysses, after having travelled far and suffered much, will return to take his\\r\\nrevenge—if indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the\\r\\nsuitors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May Jove so grant it,” replied Telemachus, “if it should prove to be so, I\\r\\nwill make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I am at home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed through the\\r\\ntown towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and\\r\\ntravelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the\\r\\nland. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus,\\r\\nthe son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated hospitably.\\r\\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their\\r\\nhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner\\r\\ngateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus\\r\\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to\\r\\nPylos, and then Telemachus said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you. You\\r\\nknow our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age,\\r\\nand this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not, therefore,\\r\\ntake me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to your father’s house he\\r\\nwill try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go\\r\\nhome at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed\\r\\nit best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus’s beautiful\\r\\npresents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he said, “Go on\\r\\nboard at once and tell your men to do so also before I can reach home to tell\\r\\nmy father. I know how obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he\\r\\nwill come down here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he\\r\\nwill be very angry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon\\r\\nreached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and gave his orders.\\r\\n“Now, my men,” said he, “get everything in order on board the ship, and let us\\r\\nset out home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as\\r\\nTelemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in the\\r\\nship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was\\r\\nflying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus,\\r\\nwho used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great\\r\\nhouse, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus.\\r\\nNeleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a\\r\\nclose prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both\\r\\non account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great\\r\\nsorrow that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped\\r\\nwith his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that\\r\\nhad been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left\\r\\nthe country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over\\r\\nmuch people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons\\r\\nAntiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of\\r\\nAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not\\r\\nlive to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His\\r\\nsons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was\\r\\nfather to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus\\r\\nfor his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made\\r\\nPolypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.\\r\\nHe quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained\\r\\nand prophesied for all men.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was making\\r\\ndrink-offerings and praying in his ship. “Friend,” said he, “now that I find\\r\\nyou sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices themselves, and\\r\\nby the god to whom you make them, I pray you also by your own head and by those\\r\\nof your followers tell me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence\\r\\nare you? Tell me also of your town and parents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus said, “I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and my\\r\\nfather is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some\\r\\nmiserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see\\r\\nif I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long time.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above Ortygia,[134] where the land\\r\\nbegins to turn round and look in another direction.[135] It is not very thickly peopled, but\\r\\nthe soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds\\r\\nwith wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by\\r\\nany sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them\\r\\nwith his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is\\r\\ndivided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a man comparable\\r\\nto the gods, reigned over both.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for the\\r\\nPhoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with gewgaws\\r\\nof all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father’s house,\\r\\nvery tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of\\r\\nher one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her\\r\\nin ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The\\r\\nman who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\\r\\nthis she told him her father’s name. ‘I come from Sidon,’ said she, ‘and am\\r\\ndaughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the\\r\\ntown from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the\\r\\nsea, where they sold me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their\\r\\nprice for me.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would you like to come along with us\\r\\nto see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? They are both\\r\\nalive and are said to be well off.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you men will first swear me a solemn\\r\\noath that you will do me no harm by the way.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their oath the\\r\\nwoman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the\\r\\nwell, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and tell my\\r\\nmaster, in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison,\\r\\nand would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your\\r\\nmerchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I\\r\\nwill bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else\\r\\nalso that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\\r\\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry\\r\\nhim off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you\\r\\ntake him and sell him in foreign parts.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till\\r\\nthey had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they\\r\\nhad got freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very\\r\\ncunning fellow, came to my father’s house bringing a necklace of gold with\\r\\namber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in\\r\\ntheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the\\r\\nwoman and then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\\r\\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with\\r\\nthe cups of guests who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance\\r\\non him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she\\r\\nsnatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I\\r\\nfollowed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over\\r\\nall the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\\r\\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed\\r\\ntheir ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind;\\r\\nsix days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck\\r\\nthe woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were a\\r\\nsea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and\\r\\nfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves\\r\\ntook the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and\\r\\nthus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes with the\\r\\nmost lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as well as evil, for\\r\\nin spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you always have\\r\\nenough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life, whereas I am still going\\r\\nabout begging my way from city to city.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for sleep,\\r\\nfor it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his crew were nearing\\r\\nland, so they loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the\\r\\nharbour.[136]\\r\\nThey cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out\\r\\nupon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had\\r\\nhad enough to eat and drink Telemachus said, “Take the ship on to the town, but\\r\\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the\\r\\nevening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and\\r\\nto-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner\\r\\nwith meat and wine.” [137]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Theoclymenus said, “And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To\\r\\nwhose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or shall I go straight\\r\\nto your own house and to your mother?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At any other time,” replied Telemachus, “I should have bidden you go to my own\\r\\nhouse, for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment,\\r\\nhowever, you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my mother\\r\\nwill not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors, but sits\\r\\nat her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a\\r\\nman whose house you can go to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held\\r\\nin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and\\r\\nthe most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother and\\r\\ntrying to take Ulysses’ place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows whether or\\r\\nno they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo’s\\r\\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them\\r\\noff,[138] fell to\\r\\nthe ground midway between Telemachus and the ship. On this Theoclymenus called\\r\\nhim apart and caught him by the hand. “Telemachus,” said he, “that bird did not\\r\\nfly on your right hand without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I\\r\\nsaw it I knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that\\r\\nthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish it may prove so,” answered Telemachus. “If it does, I will show you so\\r\\nmuch good will and give you so many presents that all who meet you will\\r\\ncongratulate you.”\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Madam,” answered Ulysses, “it is such a long time ago that I can hardly say.\\r\\nTwenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhither; but\\r\\nI will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple\\r\\nwool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for\\r\\nthe pin. On the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a\\r\\nspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the\\r\\nground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in\\r\\ngold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was\\r\\nstruggling convulsively to escape.[153] As for the shirt that he wore next\\r\\nhis skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and\\r\\nglistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it.\\r\\nFurthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether\\r\\nUlysses wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions\\r\\nhad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose\\r\\nhouse he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\\r\\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of\\r\\nbronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down\\r\\nto his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had\\r\\na servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was\\r\\nlike; his shoulders were hunched,[154] he was dark, and he had thick curly\\r\\nhair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity\\r\\nthan he did any of the others, as being the most like-minded with himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs that\\r\\nUlysses laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said\\r\\nto him, “Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall\\r\\nbe honoured and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes\\r\\nyou speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and\\r\\nI gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\\r\\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\\r\\ndetested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\\r\\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you\\r\\nfor doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would\\r\\nnaturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than\\r\\nUlysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to\\r\\nwhat I can tell you. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect\\r\\ntruth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home;\\r\\nhe is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that\\r\\nhe has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were\\r\\nlost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were\\r\\nangry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they\\r\\nwere all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was\\r\\ndrifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals,\\r\\nand who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and\\r\\nwishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here\\r\\nlong ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\\r\\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare\\r\\nwith him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to\\r\\nme—making drink-offerings in his house as he did so—that the ship was by the\\r\\nwater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He\\r\\nsent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the\\r\\nwheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses\\r\\nhad got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep\\r\\nhis family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\\r\\nthat he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after\\r\\nso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may\\r\\nknow he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain\\r\\naway from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath,\\r\\nand call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also\\r\\nthat hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall\\r\\nsurely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\\r\\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you shall have\\r\\nsuch gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate\\r\\nyou; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses will not return, neither will\\r\\nyou get your escort hence, for so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are\\r\\nnow no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to receive honourable\\r\\nstrangers or to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his\\r\\nfeet for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\\r\\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him\\r\\nagain, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It\\r\\nshall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him;\\r\\nlike it or not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall\\r\\nyou be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex both in\\r\\ngoodness of heart and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid\\r\\nand ill clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal\\r\\nhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak\\r\\ncontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals\\r\\nrighteously, the people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\\r\\nhim blessed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that\\r\\nI left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain\\r\\non many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any\\r\\nrough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my\\r\\nfeet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my\\r\\nfeet; but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\\r\\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo this Penelope said, “My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my\\r\\nhouse there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety\\r\\nas you do. There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman—the\\r\\nsame who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born, and\\r\\nnursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.”\\r\\n“Come here,” said she, “Euryclea, and wash your master’s age-mate; I suppose\\r\\nUlysses’ hands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages\\r\\nall of us dreadfully fast.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he tossed\\r\\nabout as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire,\\r\\ndoing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as\\r\\nsoon as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking\\r\\nall the time how, single handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large\\r\\na body of men as the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from\\r\\nheaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, “My poor\\r\\nunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is\\r\\nsafe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father\\r\\nmay be proud of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Goddess,” answered Ulysses, “all that you have said is true, but I am in some\\r\\ndoubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed,\\r\\nseeing what a number of them there always are. And there is this further\\r\\ndifficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with Jove’s and\\r\\nyour assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I\\r\\nam to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For shame,” replied Minerva, “why, any one else would trust a worse ally than\\r\\nmyself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I\\r\\nnot a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles? I\\r\\ntell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us\\r\\nand eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive\\r\\nthem away with you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all\\r\\nnight, and you shall be out of your troubles before long.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the\\r\\nburden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed\\r\\nbegan to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Diana\\r\\nsaying, “Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart\\r\\nand slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of\\r\\ndarkness till it drop me into the mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the\\r\\ndaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and\\r\\nmother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took\\r\\ncare of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them\\r\\nto excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an\\r\\nimposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment;\\r\\nbut one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them\\r\\nmarried (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to\\r\\nevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to\\r\\nthe dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide\\r\\nme from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go\\r\\neven beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only,\\r\\nand without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no\\r\\nmatter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as\\r\\nthey can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget\\r\\ngood and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams. This very\\r\\nnight methought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was\\r\\nwhen he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no\\r\\ndream, but the very truth itself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it\\r\\npuzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side.\\r\\nThen he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set\\r\\nthem on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock’s hide out into the\\r\\nopen. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying “Father Jove, since\\r\\nyou have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the\\r\\nafflictions you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\\r\\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another\\r\\nsign of some kind from outside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among\\r\\nthe clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard\\r\\nit. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill\\r\\nroom lifted up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve\\r\\nmiller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the\\r\\nstaff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone to take their\\r\\nrest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was not so strong as they\\r\\nwere, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to\\r\\nher master. “Father Jove,” said she, “you, who rule over heaven and earth, you\\r\\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this\\r\\nmeans something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor servant\\r\\nwho calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in\\r\\nthe house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for\\r\\nthem, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman’s speech,\\r\\nand by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the\\r\\nsuitors.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\\r\\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about his\\r\\nshoulder, bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and took a doughty spear\\r\\nwith a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister\\r\\nand said to Euryclea, “Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as\\r\\nregards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?—for my mother,\\r\\ngood woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate\\r\\npeople, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not find fault child,” said Euryclea, “when there is no one to find fault\\r\\nwith. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did\\r\\nask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he\\r\\nwanted to go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he\\r\\nwas such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under\\r\\nblankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock’s hide and some sheepskins\\r\\nput for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.”[157]\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were\\r\\nmeeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for\\r\\nhis two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids and said, “Come, wake\\r\\nup; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the\\r\\ndust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a\\r\\nwet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and go for water from the\\r\\nfountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\\r\\nfor it is a feast day.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to\\r\\nthe fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the\\r\\nhouse. The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began\\r\\nchopping firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the\\r\\nswineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he\\r\\nlet feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\\r\\n“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent\\r\\nas ever?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with which they\\r\\ndeal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense of shame.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too\\r\\nwas bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two\\r\\nshepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\\r\\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here, stranger,” said he,\\r\\n“to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You\\r\\nand I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a\\r\\ntaste of our fists. You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts\\r\\nelsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man,\\r\\nPhiloetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats.\\r\\nThese were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when\\r\\nany one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under\\r\\nthe gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he,\\r\\n“is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his\\r\\nfamily? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\\r\\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so\\r\\npleases them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand; “Good\\r\\nday to you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem to be very poorly off now, but\\r\\nI hope you will have better times by and by. Father Jove, of all gods you are\\r\\nthe most malicious. We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all\\r\\nour misery and afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my\\r\\neyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about\\r\\nin just such rags as this man’s are, if indeed he is still among the living. If\\r\\nhe is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\\r\\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians, and\\r\\nnow his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them than I\\r\\nhave, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep\\r\\nbringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son though he is in\\r\\nthe house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide\\r\\nUlysses’ property among them because he has been away so long. I have often\\r\\nthought—only it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with\\r\\nthe cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\\r\\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people’s herds. My position is\\r\\nintolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the\\r\\nprotection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet\\r\\nreturn, and send all these suitors flying out of the house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and\\r\\nI can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will\\r\\nconfirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that\\r\\nhearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave\\r\\nthis place, and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who\\r\\nare now masters here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Jove were to bring this to pass,” replied the stockman, “you should see how\\r\\nI would do my very utmost to help him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder\\r\\nTelemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an eagle with a dove\\r\\nin its talons. On this Amphinomus said, “My friends, this plot of ours to\\r\\nmurder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches\\r\\nand seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the\\r\\ninward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine in the\\r\\nmixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed\\r\\nround the bread in the bread baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their\\r\\nwine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was\\r\\npaved with stone;[158] he gave him a shabby looking seat\\r\\nat a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\\r\\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. “Sit there,” said he, “and drink your wine\\r\\namong the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the\\r\\nsuitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses, and has passed\\r\\nfrom him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to\\r\\nyourselves, or there will be mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then\\r\\nAntinous said, “We do not like such language but we will put up with it, for\\r\\nTelemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove had let us we should have\\r\\nput a stop to his brave talk ere now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were\\r\\nbringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under\\r\\nthe shady grove of Apollo.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his\\r\\nportion, and feasted to their heart’s content; those who waited at table gave\\r\\nUlysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told\\r\\nthem to do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for\\r\\nshe wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now there happened\\r\\nto be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from\\r\\nSame. This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of\\r\\nUlysses, and said to the suitors, “Hear what I have to say. The stranger has\\r\\nalready had as large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not\\r\\nright nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I\\r\\nwill, however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have something\\r\\nto give to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses’ servants.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope’s mind to make the suitors try their skill with\\r\\nthe bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of\\r\\nbringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store-room key,\\r\\nwhich was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her\\r\\nmaidens into the store-room at the end of the house, where her husband’s\\r\\ntreasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his\\r\\nbow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend\\r\\nwhom he had met in Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with\\r\\none another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\r\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\r\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away\\r\\nwith them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long\\r\\njourney while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent\\r\\nhim on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get\\r\\nback twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running\\r\\nwith them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to\\r\\nthe house of Jove’s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of\\r\\nvalour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he\\r\\nfeared not heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set\\r\\nbefore Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\r\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the\\r\\nbow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had\\r\\nbeen left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear,\\r\\nand this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at\\r\\none another’s houses, for Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do\\r\\nso. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by\\r\\nUlysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home,\\r\\nbut had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the carpenter\\r\\nhad planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite\\r\\nstraight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed\\r\\nthe strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight\\r\\nhome to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;[161] these flew open with a noise like a\\r\\nbull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform,\\r\\nwhere the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along\\r\\nwith fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case\\r\\nfrom the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping\\r\\nbitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved\\r\\nher, she went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the\\r\\nquiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came\\r\\nher maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her\\r\\nhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of\\r\\nthe bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before\\r\\nher face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house\\r\\nbecause its owner has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you\\r\\nwant to marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I\\r\\nwill bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it\\r\\nmost easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I\\r\\nfollow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in\\r\\nwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the\\r\\nsuitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by,\\r\\nthe stockman wept also when he saw his master’s bow, but Antinous scolded them.\\r\\n“You country louts,” said he, “silly simpletons; why should you add to the\\r\\nsorrows of your mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in\\r\\nthe loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence,\\r\\nor go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\\r\\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light\\r\\nmatter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\r\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I was\\r\\nthen only a child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string\\r\\nthe bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that\\r\\nshould taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring\\r\\nin his own house—egging the others on to do so also.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus spoke. “Great heavens!” he exclaimed, “Jove must have robbed me\\r\\nof my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this\\r\\nhouse and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there\\r\\nwere nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let\\r\\nit go forward. It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos,\\r\\nor Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I\\r\\ndo; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\\r\\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too\\r\\nwill make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I\\r\\nshall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win\\r\\nthe prizes which my father won before me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took\\r\\nhis sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove\\r\\nwhich he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.[162] Then he\\r\\nstamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw\\r\\nhim set them up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind\\r\\nbefore. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice\\r\\ndid he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he\\r\\nhad to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the\\r\\niron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not\\r\\nUlysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young,\\r\\nand have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if\\r\\nany one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are stronger than I, make trial\\r\\nof the bow and get this contest settled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led into\\r\\nthe house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down\\r\\non the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at\\r\\nwhich the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He was\\r\\nsacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl.\\r\\n[163] He was the\\r\\nonly man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others. He was\\r\\nnow the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make\\r\\nhis trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused\\r\\nto hard work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, “My\\r\\nfriends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life\\r\\nand soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\r\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has\\r\\nbrought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that\\r\\nhe may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo\\r\\nand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever\\r\\nmakes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,[164] with the arrow\\r\\nstanding against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat\\r\\nfrom which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable;\\r\\nit makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life of many\\r\\na chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were\\r\\nnot born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, “Look sharp, light a fire in the\\r\\ncourt, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large\\r\\nball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease\\r\\nit—we will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He\\r\\nalso brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the\\r\\nsuitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them\\r\\nnearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless there still remained Antinous\\r\\nand Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the\\r\\nforemost among them all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses\\r\\nfollowed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses\\r\\nsaid to them quietly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt\\r\\nwhether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you\\r\\nbe to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?\\r\\nSay which you are disposed to do—to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Father Jove,” answered the stockman, “would indeed that you might so ordain\\r\\nit. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might\\r\\nand main I would fight for him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return; when,\\r\\ntherefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said, “It is I,\\r\\nUlysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year,\\r\\nI am come back to my own country. I find that you two alone of all my servants\\r\\nare glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying\\r\\nfor my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be.\\r\\nIf heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\\r\\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\r\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give you\\r\\nconvincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is the scar\\r\\nfrom the boar’s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Mt. Parnassus\\r\\nwith the sons of Autolycus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had\\r\\nexamined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms\\r\\nround him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands\\r\\nand faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if\\r\\nUlysses had not checked them and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and tell\\r\\nthose who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I\\r\\nwill go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this moreover be the token\\r\\nbetween us; the suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of\\r\\nthe bow and quiver; do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you\\r\\nare carrying it about, and tell the women to close the doors of their\\r\\napartment. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at\\r\\ntheir work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer\\r\\ncourt, and to bind them securely at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat that he\\r\\nhad left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by\\r\\nthe fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He\\r\\nheaved a deep sigh and said, “I grieve for myself and for us all; I grieve that\\r\\nI shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about\\r\\nthis, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel\\r\\nmost is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot\\r\\nstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It shall not be so, Eurymachus,” said Antinous, “and you know it yourself.\\r\\nToday is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on\\r\\nsuch a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes they can stay where they\\r\\nare, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the\\r\\ncupbearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop\\r\\nthis matter of the bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats\\r\\ntomorrow—the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\\r\\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over the\\r\\nhands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water\\r\\nand handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they\\r\\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses\\r\\ncraftily said:—\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded.\\r\\nI appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken\\r\\nwith so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the\\r\\ngods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will. For the\\r\\nmoment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among\\r\\nyou all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or\\r\\nwhether travel and neglect have made an end of it.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\r\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, “Wretched creature, you have\\r\\nnot so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself\\r\\nlucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having any\\r\\nsmaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to\\r\\nhear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear\\r\\nwhat we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as\\r\\nit does with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the\\r\\nCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When\\r\\nthe wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\\r\\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed\\r\\nat him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the\\r\\ndoorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his\\r\\ncrime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between\\r\\nmankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own\\r\\ndrunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if\\r\\nyou string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at\\r\\nonce ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you\\r\\nwill never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a\\r\\nquarrel with men younger than yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPenelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that you\\r\\nshould ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house. If the\\r\\nstranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can\\r\\nyou suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the\\r\\nman himself can have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that\\r\\ndisturb his feasting; it would be out of all reason.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Queen Penelope,” answered Eurymachus, “we do not suppose that this man will\\r\\ntake you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the\\r\\nbaser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say,\\r\\n‘These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave\\r\\nman whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who\\r\\ncame to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.’ This\\r\\nis what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Eurymachus,” Penelope answered, “people who persist in eating up the estate of\\r\\na great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think\\r\\nwell of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? This\\r\\nstranger is strong and well-built, he says moreover that he is of noble birth.\\r\\nGive him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no. I say—and it\\r\\nshall surely be—that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\\r\\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and\\r\\nrobbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\r\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Telemachus said, “Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the\\r\\nislands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one have the\\r\\nbow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even\\r\\nthough I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright, and let him\\r\\ntake it away with him. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\\r\\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This\\r\\nbow is a man’s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son’s saying in her heart.\\r\\nThen going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear\\r\\nhusband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but the\\r\\nsuitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said,\\r\\n“You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If\\r\\nApollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get\\r\\nyou into some quiet little place, and worry you to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down\\r\\nthen and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the\\r\\ncloisters, and threatened him saying, “Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in\\r\\nspite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the\\r\\ncountry, for I am the better man of the two. I wish I was as much stronger than\\r\\nall the other suitors in the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of\\r\\nthem off sick and sorry, for they mean mischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a\\r\\nbetter humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in\\r\\nthe hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called Euryclea apart and said\\r\\nto her, “Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women’s\\r\\napartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the\\r\\nhouse, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are\\r\\nat their work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women’s apartments.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer\\r\\ncourt. There was a ship’s cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he\\r\\nmade the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he\\r\\nhad left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands,\\r\\nand was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the\\r\\nworms had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would one\\r\\nturn towards his neighbour saying, “This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\\r\\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\r\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnother said, “I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is\\r\\nlikely to be in stringing this bow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as\\r\\neasily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted\\r\\ngut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string,\\r\\nand it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The\\r\\nsuitors were dismayed, and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment,\\r\\nmoreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as\\r\\nhe heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\n---------new doc---------\\n“Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his\\r\\nswineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage\\r\\nto Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our\\r\\ndestruction. Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the\\r\\nswineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were\\r\\nsome miserable old beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him,\\r\\nnot even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him.\\r\\nHe endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\\r\\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and\\r\\nTelemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\\r\\nbehind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of\\r\\niron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of\\r\\nour end, for not one of us could string the bow—nor nearly do so. When it was\\r\\nabout to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should\\r\\nnot be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his\\r\\nhaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his\\r\\narrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured\\r\\nhis arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous,\\r\\nand then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\\r\\nthick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them,\\r\\nfor they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there\\r\\nwas a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the\\r\\nground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and\\r\\nour bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends\\r\\nat home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and\\r\\nwash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the\\r\\noffices due to the departed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,” replied the ghost of Agamemnon, “you are\\r\\nindeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of\\r\\nunderstanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of\\r\\nIcarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals\\r\\nshall compose a song that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the\\r\\nconstancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of\\r\\nTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\\r\\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the\\r\\nearth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town and soon reached\\r\\nthe fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with infinite\\r\\nlabour. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the\\r\\nslaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there\\r\\nwas an old Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When\\r\\nUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner. Meanwhile\\r\\nI want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to recognise me after so\\r\\nlong an absence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went\\r\\nstraight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial\\r\\nof his father. As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolius,\\r\\nnor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering\\r\\nthorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had\\r\\ntold them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a\\r\\ndirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs\\r\\nof oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather;\\r\\nhe had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When\\r\\nUlysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall\\r\\npear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and\\r\\ntell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question\\r\\nhim and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with\\r\\nhim, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging\\r\\nabout a plant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see, sir,” said Ulysses, “that you are an excellent gardener—what pains you\\r\\ntake with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine,\\r\\nolive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust,\\r\\nhowever, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of\\r\\nyour garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It\\r\\ncannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,\\r\\nindeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\\r\\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should\\r\\nwash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do; but\\r\\ntell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you\\r\\nworking? Tell me also about another matter. Is this place that I have come to\\r\\nreally Ithaca? I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and\\r\\nhad not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old\\r\\nfriend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\\r\\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once\\r\\nwhen I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I\\r\\nliked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was\\r\\nLaertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all\\r\\nthe abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary\\r\\npresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with\\r\\nflowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of\\r\\ntapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve\\r\\nfair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I added four good\\r\\nlooking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.”\\n---------new doc---------\\nHis father shed tears and answered, “Sir, you have indeed come to the country\\r\\nthat you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked people. All this\\r\\nwealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have found your\\r\\nfriend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would\\r\\nhave requited your presents amply when you left him—as would have been only\\r\\nright considering what you had already given him. But tell me, and tell me\\r\\ntrue, how many years is it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as\\r\\never was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea\\r\\nhave eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some\\r\\ncontinent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could\\r\\nthrow our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent\\r\\nand richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his\\r\\ndeath bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But\\r\\nnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you—tell me of your\\r\\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to\\r\\nIthaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man’s ship, and those who brought\\r\\nyou here have gone on their way and left you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you everything,” answered Ulysses, “quite truly. I come from\\r\\nAlybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who is the son of\\r\\nPolypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I was\\r\\nleaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my will. As for my ship\\r\\nit is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the\\r\\nfifth year since Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good\\r\\nfor him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and\\r\\nI rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have\\r\\nanother friendly meeting and exchange presents.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both hands\\r\\nwith the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey head, groaning\\r\\nheavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils\\r\\nquivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him, flung his\\r\\narms about him and kissed him, saying, “I am he, father, about whom you are\\r\\nasking—I have returned after having been away for twenty years. But cease your\\r\\nsighing and lamentation—we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I\\r\\nhave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence\\r\\nand crimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you really are my son Ulysses,” replied Laertes, “and have come back again,\\r\\nyou must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall convince me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First observe this scar,” answered Ulysses, “which I got from a boar’s tusk\\r\\nwhen I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to\\r\\nAutolycus, my mother’s father, to receive the presents which when he was over\\r\\nhere he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out to you the trees\\r\\nin the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed\\r\\nyou round the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and\\r\\nwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\\r\\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn\\r\\nplanted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of\\r\\nheaven has been laid heavy upon them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes’ strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son\\r\\nhad given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or\\r\\nhe would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to, and was\\r\\nbeginning to recover his senses, he said, “O father Jove, then you gods are\\r\\nstill in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their\\r\\ninsolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the\\r\\ntownspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers\\r\\neverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUlysses answered, “Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that, but let\\r\\nus go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told Telemachus,\\r\\nPhiloetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as\\r\\npossible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got there\\r\\nthey found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and\\r\\nmixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed\\r\\nhim and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up\\r\\nto him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter\\r\\nthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\\r\\nan immortal, and said to him, “My dear father, some one of the gods has been\\r\\nmaking you much taller and better-looking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLaertes answered, “Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the\\r\\nman I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took Nericum, that strong\\r\\nfortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had been in our\\r\\nhouse yesterday with my armour on, I should have been able to stand by you and\\r\\nhelp you against the suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and\\r\\nyou would have rejoiced to see it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their work and\\r\\nthe feast was ready, left off working, and took each his proper place on the\\r\\nbenches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old Dolius and his sons\\r\\nleft their work and came up, for their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after\\r\\nLaertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw\\r\\nUlysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but\\r\\nUlysses scolded them good naturedly and said, “Sit down to your dinner, old\\r\\nman, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for some\\r\\ntime and have been waiting for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. “Sir,” said he,\\r\\nseizing his master’s hand and kissing it at the wrist, “we have long been\\r\\nwishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up\\r\\nhoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.[187] But tell me,\\r\\ndoes Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Old man,” answered Ulysses, “she knows already, so you need not trouble about\\r\\nthat.” On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses\\r\\nto give him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took their\\r\\nseats in due order near Dolius their father.\"\n",

overview\\nAttention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \\\"soft\\\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\\nUnlike \\\"hard\\\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \\\"soft\\\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\nAcademic reviews of the history of the attention mechanism are provided in Niu et al.[1] and Soydaner.[2]\\n---------new doc---------\\nPredecessors[edit]\\nSelective attention in humans had been well studied in neuroscience and cognitive psychology.[3] In 1953, Colin Cherry studied selective attention in the context of audition, known as the cocktail party effect.[4]\\nIn 1958, Donald Broadbent proposed the filter model of attention.[5] Selective attention of vision was studied in the 1960s by George Sperling's partial report paradigm. It was also noticed that saccade control is modulated by cognitive processes, insofar as the eye moves preferentially towards areas of high salience. As the fovea of the eye is small, the eye cannot sharply resolve the entire visual field at once. The use of saccade control allows the eye to quickly scan important features of a scene.[6]\\nThese research developments inspired algorithms such as the Neocognitron and its variants.[7][8] Meanwhile, developments in neural networks had inspired circuit models of biological visual attention.[9][2] One well-cited network from 1998, for example, was inspired by the low-level primate visual system. It produced saliency maps of images using handcrafted (not learned) features, which were then used to guide a second neural network in processing patches of the image in order of reducing saliency.[10]\\nA key aspect of attention mechanism can be written (schematically) as: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟨\\n(\\n\\nquery\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n,\\n(\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟩\\n(\\n\\nvalue\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum _{i}\\\\langle ({\\\\text{query}})_{i},({\\\\text{key}})_{i}\\\\rangle ({\\\\text{value}})_{i}}\\n\\nwhere the angled brackets denote dot product. This shows that it involves a multiplicative operation. Multiplicative operations within artificial neural networks had been studied under the names of Group Method of Data Handling (1965)[11][12] (where Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials implement multiplicative units or \\\"gates\\\"[13]), higher-order neural networks,[14] multiplication units,[15] sigma-pi units,[16] fast weight controllers,[17] and hyper-networks.[18]\\nIn fast weight controller (Schmidhuber, 1992), one of its two networks has  \\\"fast weights\\\" or \\\"dynamic links\\\" (1981).[19][20][21] A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries.[17] This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.[22] A follow-up paper developed a similar system with active weight changing.[23]\\n\\nRecurrent attention[edit]\\nDuring the deep learning era, attention mechanism was developed to solve similar problems in encoding-decoding.[1]\\nIn machine translation, the seq2seq model, as it was proposed in 2014,[24] would encode an input text into a fixed-length vector, which would then be decoded into an output text. If the input text is long, the fixed-length vector would be unable to carry enough information for accurate decoding. An attention mechanism was proposed to solve this problem.\\nAn image captioning model was proposed in 2015, citing inspiration from the seq2seq model.[25] that would encode an input image into a fixed-length vector. Xu et al (2015),[26] citing Bahdanau et al (2014),[27] applied the attention mechanism as used in the seq2seq model to image captioning.\\n\\nTransformer[edit]\\nSee also: Transformer (deep learning architecture) § History\\nOne problem with seq2seq models was their use of recurrent neural networks, which are not parallelizable as both the encoder and the decoder must process the sequence token-by-token. Decomposable attention[28] attempted to solve this problem by processing the input sequence in parallel, before computing a \\\"soft alignment matrix\\\" (alignment is the terminology used by Bahdanau et al[27]) in order to allow for parallel processing.\\nThe idea of using the attention mechanism for self-attention, instead of in an encoder-decoder (cross-attention), was also proposed during this period, such as in differentiable neural computers[29] and neural Turing machines.[30] It was termed intra-attention[31] where an LSTM is augmented with a memory network as it encodes an input sequence.\\nThese strands of development were brought together in 2017 with the Transformer architecture, published in the Attention Is All You Need paper.\\n\\nOverview[edit]\\nThe attention network was designed to identify high correlations patterns amongst words in a given sentence, assuming that it has learned word correlation patterns from the training data.  This correlation is captured as neuronal weights learned during training with backpropagation.\\nThe diagram shows the Attention forward pass calculating correlations of the word \\\"that\\\" with other words in \\\"See that girl run.\\\"  Given the right weights from training, the network should be able to identify \\\"girl\\\" as a highly correlated word.  Some things to note:\\nThis example focuses on the attention of a single word \\\"that\\\".  In practice, the attention of each word is calculated in parallel to speed up calculations.  Simply changing the lowercase \\\"x\\\" vector to the uppercase \\\"X\\\" matrix will yield the formula for this.\\nSoftmax scaling qWkT / √100 prevents a high variance in qWkT that would allow a single word to excessively dominate the softmax resulting in attention to only one word, as a discrete hard max would do.\\nNotation: the commonly written row-wise softmax formula above assumes that vectors are rows, which runs contrary to the standard math notation of column vectors. More correctly, we should take the transpose of the context vector and use the column-wise softmax, resulting in the more correct form\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\nX\\n\\nW\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n∗\\n\\n[\\n(\\n\\nW\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n∗\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\nx\\n_\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nq\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n]\\n\\ns\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}(XW_{v})^{T}*{[(W_{k}X^{T})*{({\\\\underline {x}}W_{q})^{T}}]_{sm}}\\\\end{aligned}}}\\n\\n.\\nThis attention scheme has been compared to the Query-Key analogy of relational databases.  That comparison suggests an asymmetric role for the Query and Key vectors, where one item of interest (the Query vector \\\"that\\\") is matched against all possible items (the Key vectors of each word in the sentence).   However, both Self and Cross Attentions' parallel calculations matches all tokens of the K matrix with all tokens of the Q matrix; therefore the roles of these vectors are symmetric.  Possibly because the simplistic database analogy is flawed, much effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\n\\nMachine translation[edit]\\nComparison of the data flow in CNN, RNN, and self-attention\\nThe seq2seq method developed in the early 2010s uses two neural networks:  an encoder network converts an input sentence into numerical vectors, and a decoder network converts those vectors to sentences in the target language.  The Attention mechanism was grafted onto this structure in 2014 and shown below.  Later it was refined into the Transformer design (2017).\\n\\nA step-by-step sequence of a language translation\\n\\n\\n\\nEncoder-decoder with attention.[39] Numerical subscripts (100, 300, 500, 9k, 10k) indicate vector sizes while lettered subscripts i and i − 1 indicate time steps.

The recurrent layer has 500 neurons and the fully-connected linear layer has 10k neurons (the size of the target vocabulary).[40]   The linear layer alone has 5 million (500 × 10k) weights – ~10 times more weights than the recurrent layer.\\n\\n\\nscore\\n\\n100-long alignment score\\n\\n\\nw\\n\\n100-long vector attention weight.

In the I love you example above, the second word love is aligned with the third word aime. Stacking soft row vectors together for je, t', and aime yields an alignment matrix:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nlove\\n\\nyou\\n\\n\\nje\\n\\n0.94\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n\\nt'\\n\\n0.11\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.88\\n\\n\\naime\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.95\\n\\n0.02\\n\\nSometimes, alignment can be multiple-to-multiple. For example, the English phrase look it up corresponds to cherchez-le. Thus, \\\"soft\\\" attention weights work better than \\\"hard\\\" attention weights (setting one attention weight to 1, and the others to 0), as we would like the model to make a context vector consisting of a weighted sum of the hidden vectors, rather than \\\"the best one\\\", as there may not be a best hidden vector.\\nThis view of the attention weights addresses some of the neural network explainability problem. Networks that perform verbatim translation without regard to word order would show the highest scores along the (dominant) diagonal of the matrix. The off-diagonal dominance shows that the attention mechanism is more nuanced. On the first pass through the decoder, 94% of the attention weight is on the first English word I, so the network offers the word je. On the second pass of the decoder, 88% of the attention weight is on the third English word you, so it offers t'. On the last pass, 95% of the attention weight is on the second English word love, so it offers aime.\\n\\nseq2seq[edit]\\nProblem statement[edit]\\nAnimation of seq2seq with RNN and attention mechanism\\nConsider the seq2seq language English-to-French translation task. To be concrete, let us consider the translation of \\\"the zone of international control <end>\\\", which should translate to \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\". Here, we use the special <end> token as a control character to delimit the end of input for both the encoder and the decoder.\\nAn input sequence of text \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nx\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n is processed by a neural network (which can be an LSTM, a Transformer encoder, or some other network) into a sequence of real-valued vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, where \\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\n\\n stands for \\\"hidden vector\\\".\\nAfter the encoder has finished processing, the decoder starts operating over the hidden vectors, to produce an output sequence \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\ny\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle y_{0},y_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, autoregressively. That is, it always takes as input both the hidden vectors produced by the encoder, and what the decoder itself has produced before, to produce the next output word:\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start>\\\") → \\\"la\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la\\\") → \\\"la zone\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone\\\") → \\\"la zone de\\\"\\n...\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone de contrôle international\\\") → \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\"\\nHere, we use the special <start> token as a control character to delimit the start of input for the decoder. The decoding terminates as soon as \\\"<end>\\\" appears in the decoder output.\\n\\nAttention weights[edit]\\nAttention mechanism with attention weights, overview.As hand-crafting weights defeats the purpose of machine learning, the model must compute the attention weights on its own. Taking analogy from the language of database queries, we make the model construct a triple of vectors: key, query, and value. The rough idea is that we have a \\\"database\\\" in the form of a list of key-value pairs. The decoder sends in a query, and obtains a reply in the form of a weighted sum of the values, where the weight is proportional to how closely the query resembles each key.\\nThe decoder first processes the \\\"<start>\\\" input partially, to obtain an intermediate vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}}\\n\\n, the 0th hidden vector of decoder. Then, the intermediate vector is transformed by a linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\\n\\n into a query vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}=h_{0}^{d}W^{Q}}\\n\\n. Meanwhile, the hidden vectors outputted by the encoder are transformed by another linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{K}}\\n\\n into key vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle k_{0}=h_{0}W^{K},k_{1}=h_{1}W^{K},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. The linear maps are useful for providing the model with enough freedom to find the best way to represent the data.\\nNow, the query and keys are compared by taking dot products: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{0}^{T},q_{0}k_{1}^{T},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. Ideally, the model should have learned to compute the keys and values, such that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{0}^{T}}\\n\\n is large, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{1}^{T}}\\n\\n is small, and the rest are very small. This can be interpreted as saying that the attention weight should be mostly applied to the 0th hidden vector of the encoder, a little to the 1st, and essentially none to the rest.\\nIn order to make a properly weighted sum, we need to transform this list of dot products into a probability distribution over \\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n,\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle 0,1,\\\\dots }\\n---------new doc---------\\n. This can be accomplished by the softmax function, thus giving us the attention weights:\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\nw\\n\\n00\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nw\\n\\n01\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n)\\n=\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n(\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle (w_{00},w_{01},\\\\dots )=\\\\mathrm {softmax} (q_{0}k_{0}^{T},q_{0}k_{1}^{T},\\\\dots )}\\n\\nThis is then used to compute the context vector:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nw\\n\\n00\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nw\\n\\n01\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n+\\n⋯\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{0}=w_{00}v_{0}+w_{01}v_{1}+\\\\cdots }\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nv\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle v_{0}=h_{0}W^{V},v_{1}=h_{1}W^{V},\\\\dots }\\n\\n are the value vectors, linearly transformed by another matrix to provide the model with freedom to find the best way to represent values.

This is the \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\".This is the dot-attention mechanism. The particular version described in this section is \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\", as the output context vector is used by the decoder, and the input keys and values come from the encoder, but the query comes from the decoder, thus \\\"cross-attention\\\".\\nMore succinctly, we can write it as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nA\\nt\\nt\\ne\\nn\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n(\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{0}=\\\\mathrm {Attention} (h_{0}^{d}W^{Q},HW^{K},HW^{V})=\\\\mathrm {softmax} ((h_{0}^{d}W^{Q})\\\\;(HW^{K})^{T})(HW^{V})}\\n\\nwhere the matrix \\n\\n\\n\\nH\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle H}\\n\\n is the matrix whose rows are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n.

In fact, it is theoretically possible for query, key, and value vectors to all be different, though that is rarely done in practice.\\n\\nVariants[edit]\\nMany variants of attention implement soft weights, such as\\n\\nfast weight programmers, or fast weight controllers (1992).[17] A \\\"slow\\\" neural network outputs the \\\"fast\\\" weights of another neural network through outer products. The slow network learns by gradient descent. It was later renamed as \\\"linearized self-attention\\\".[22]\\nBahdanau-style attention,[41] also referred to as additive attention,\\nLuong-style attention,[42] which is known as multiplicative attention,\\nhighly parallelizable self-attention introduced in 2016 as decomposable attention[31] and successfully used in transformers a year later,\\npositional attention and factorized positional attention.[43]\\nFor convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms can be distinguished by the dimension on which they operate, namely: spatial attention,[44] channel attention,[45] or combinations.[46][47]\\nMuch effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\nThese variants recombine the encoder-side inputs to redistribute those effects to each target output. Often, a correlation-style matrix of dot products provides the re-weighting coefficients.  In the figures below, W is the matrix of context attention weights, similar to the formula in Core Calculations section above.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. encoder-decoder dot product\\n\\n2. encoder-decoder QKV\\n\\n3. encoder-only dot product\\n\\n4. encoder-only QKV\\n\\n5.

For example, H is a matrix of the encoder hidden state—one word per column.\\n\\n\\nS, T\\nS, decoder hidden state; T, target word embedding. In the Pytorch Tutorial variant training phase, T alternates between 2 sources depending on the level of teacher forcing used. T could be the embedding of the network's output word; i.e. embedding(argmax(FC output)). Alternatively with teacher forcing, T could be the embedding of the known correct word which can occur with a constant forcing probability, say 1/2.\\n\\n\\nX, H\\nH, encoder hidden state; X, input word embeddings.\\n\\n\\nW\\nAttention coefficients\\n\\n\\nQw, Kw, Vw, FC\\nWeight matrices for query, key, value respectively.

The dot products are xi * xj in variant #3, hi* sj in variant 1, and column i ( Kw * H ) * column j ( Qw * S ) in variant 2, and column i ( Kw * X ) * column j ( Qw * X ) in variant 4. Variant 5 uses a fully-connected layer to determine the coefficients. If the variant is QKV, then the dot products are normalized by the √d where d is the height of the QKV matrices.\\n\\nSelf-attention[edit]\\nEncoder self-attention, block diagram\\nEncoder self-attention, detailed diagramSelf-attention is essentially the same as cross-attention, except that query, key, and value vectors all come from the same model. Both encoder and decoder can use self-attention, but with subtle differences.\\nFor encoder self-attention, we can start with a simple encoder without self-attention, such as an \\\"embedding layer\\\", which simply converts each input word into a vector by a fixed lookup table. This gives a sequence of hidden vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n.

This can be applied repeatedly, to obtain a multilayered encoder. This is the \\\"encoder self-attention\\\", sometimes called the \\\"all-to-all attention\\\", as the vector at every position can attend to every other.\\n\\nMasking[edit]\\nDecoder self-attention with causal masking, detailed diagramFor decoder self-attention, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because during the autoregressive decoding process, the decoder cannot attend to future outputs that has yet to be decoded. This can be solved by forcing the attention weights \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nw\\n\\ni\\nj\\n\\n\\n=\\n0\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle w_{ij}=0}\\n\\n for all \\n\\n\\n\\ni\\n<\\nj\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle i<j}\\n\\n, called \\\"causal masking\\\". This attention mechanism is the \\\"causally masked self-attention\\\".\\nOptimizations[edit]\\nFlash attention[edit]\\nThe size of the attention matrix is proportional to the square of the number of input tokens. Therefore, when the input is long, calculating the attention matrix requires a lot of GPU memory. Flash attention is an implementation that reduces the memory needs and increases efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. It achieves this by partitioning the attention computation into smaller blocks that fit into the GPU's faster on-chip memory, reducing the need to store large intermediate matrices and thus lowering memory usage while increasing computational efficiency.[52]\\n\\nMathematical representation[edit]\\nStandard Scaled Dot-Product Attention[edit]\\nFor matrices: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{m\\\\times d_{k}}} ,\\\\mathbf {K} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{k}}} }\\n\\n and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{v}}} }\\n\\n, the scaled dot-product, or QKV attention is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention\\n\\n(\\n\\nQ\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n,\\n\\nV\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\nsoftmax\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\mathbf {V} )={\\\\text{softmax}}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\mathbf {K} ^{T}}{\\\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R} ^{m\\\\times d_{v}}}\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {}^{T}}\\n\\n denotes transpose and the softmax function is applied independently to every row of its argument.

overview\\nAttention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \\\"soft\\\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\\nUnlike \\\"hard\\\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \\\"soft\\\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\nAcademic reviews of the history of the attention mechanism are provided in Niu et al.[1] and Soydaner.[2]\\n---------new doc---------\\nPredecessors[edit]\\nSelective attention in humans had been well studied in neuroscience and cognitive psychology.[3] In 1953, Colin Cherry studied selective attention in the context of audition, known as the cocktail party effect.[4]\\nIn 1958, Donald Broadbent proposed the filter model of attention.[5] Selective attention of vision was studied in the 1960s by George Sperling's partial report paradigm. It was also noticed that saccade control is modulated by cognitive processes, insofar as the eye moves preferentially towards areas of high salience. As the fovea of the eye is small, the eye cannot sharply resolve the entire visual field at once. The use of saccade control allows the eye to quickly scan important features of a scene.[6]\\nThese research developments inspired algorithms such as the Neocognitron and its variants.[7][8] Meanwhile, developments in neural networks had inspired circuit models of biological visual attention.[9][2] One well-cited network from 1998, for example, was inspired by the low-level primate visual system. It produced saliency maps of images using handcrafted (not learned) features, which were then used to guide a second neural network in processing patches of the image in order of reducing saliency.[10]\\nA key aspect of attention mechanism can be written (schematically) as: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟨\\n(\\n\\nquery\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n,\\n(\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟩\\n(\\n\\nvalue\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum _{i}\\\\langle ({\\\\text{query}})_{i},({\\\\text{key}})_{i}\\\\rangle ({\\\\text{value}})_{i}}\\n\\nwhere the angled brackets denote dot product. This shows that it involves a multiplicative operation. Multiplicative operations within artificial neural networks had been studied under the names of Group Method of Data Handling (1965)[11][12] (where Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials implement multiplicative units or \\\"gates\\\"[13]), higher-order neural networks,[14] multiplication units,[15] sigma-pi units,[16] fast weight controllers,[17] and hyper-networks.[18]\\nIn fast weight controller (Schmidhuber, 1992), one of its two networks has  \\\"fast weights\\\" or \\\"dynamic links\\\" (1981).[19][20][21] A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries.[17] This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.[22] A follow-up paper developed a similar system with active weight changing.[23]\\n\\nRecurrent attention[edit]\\nDuring the deep learning era, attention mechanism was developed to solve similar problems in encoding-decoding.[1]\\nIn machine translation, the seq2seq model, as it was proposed in 2014,[24] would encode an input text into a fixed-length vector, which would then be decoded into an output text. If the input text is long, the fixed-length vector would be unable to carry enough information for accurate decoding. An attention mechanism was proposed to solve this problem.\\nAn image captioning model was proposed in 2015, citing inspiration from the seq2seq model.[25] that would encode an input image into a fixed-length vector. Xu et al (2015),[26] citing Bahdanau et al (2014),[27] applied the attention mechanism as used in the seq2seq model to image captioning.\\n\\nTransformer[edit]\\nSee also: Transformer (deep learning architecture) § History\\nOne problem with seq2seq models was their use of recurrent neural networks, which are not parallelizable as both the encoder and the decoder must process the sequence token-by-token. Decomposable attention[28] attempted to solve this problem by processing the input sequence in parallel, before computing a \\\"soft alignment matrix\\\" (alignment is the terminology used by Bahdanau et al[27]) in order to allow for parallel processing.\\nThe idea of using the attention mechanism for self-attention, instead of in an encoder-decoder (cross-attention), was also proposed during this period, such as in differentiable neural computers[29] and neural Turing machines.[30] It was termed intra-attention[31] where an LSTM is augmented with a memory network as it encodes an input sequence.\\nThese strands of development were brought together in 2017 with the Transformer architecture, published in the Attention Is All You Need paper.\\n\\nOverview[edit]\\nThe attention network was designed to identify high correlations patterns amongst words in a given sentence, assuming that it has learned word correlation patterns from the training data.  This correlation is captured as neuronal weights learned during training with backpropagation.\\nThe diagram shows the Attention forward pass calculating correlations of the word \\\"that\\\" with other words in \\\"See that girl run.\\\"  Given the right weights from training, the network should be able to identify \\\"girl\\\" as a highly correlated word.  Some things to note:\\nThis example focuses on the attention of a single word \\\"that\\\".  In practice, the attention of each word is calculated in parallel to speed up calculations.  Simply changing the lowercase \\\"x\\\" vector to the uppercase \\\"X\\\" matrix will yield the formula for this.\\nSoftmax scaling qWkT / √100 prevents a high variance in qWkT that would allow a single word to excessively dominate the softmax resulting in attention to only one word, as a discrete hard max would do.\\nNotation: the commonly written row-wise softmax formula above assumes that vectors are rows, which runs contrary to the standard math notation of column vectors. More correctly, we should take the transpose of the context vector and use the column-wise softmax, resulting in the more correct form\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\nX\\n\\nW\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n∗\\n\\n[\\n(\\n\\nW\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n∗\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\nx\\n_\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nq\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n]\\n\\ns\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}(XW_{v})^{T}*{[(W_{k}X^{T})*{({\\\\underline {x}}W_{q})^{T}}]_{sm}}\\\\end{aligned}}}\\n\\n.\\nThis attention scheme has been compared to the Query-Key analogy of relational databases.  That comparison suggests an asymmetric role for the Query and Key vectors, where one item of interest (the Query vector \\\"that\\\") is matched against all possible items (the Key vectors of each word in the sentence).   However, both Self and Cross Attentions' parallel calculations matches all tokens of the K matrix with all tokens of the Q matrix; therefore the roles of these vectors are symmetric.  Possibly because the simplistic database analogy is flawed, much effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\n\\nMachine translation[edit]\\nComparison of the data flow in CNN, RNN, and self-attention\\nThe seq2seq method developed in the early 2010s uses two neural networks:  an encoder network converts an input sentence into numerical vectors, and a decoder network converts those vectors to sentences in the target language.  The Attention mechanism was grafted onto this structure in 2014 and shown below.  Later it was refined into the Transformer design (2017).\\n\\nA step-by-step sequence of a language translation\\n\\n\\n\\nEncoder-decoder with attention.[39] Numerical subscripts (100, 300, 500, 9k, 10k) indicate vector sizes while lettered subscripts i and i − 1 indicate time steps.

The recurrent layer has 500 neurons and the fully-connected linear layer has 10k neurons (the size of the target vocabulary).[40]   The linear layer alone has 5 million (500 × 10k) weights – ~10 times more weights than the recurrent layer.\\n\\n\\nscore\\n\\n100-long alignment score\\n\\n\\nw\\n\\n100-long vector attention weight.

In the I love you example above, the second word love is aligned with the third word aime. Stacking soft row vectors together for je, t', and aime yields an alignment matrix:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nlove\\n\\nyou\\n\\n\\nje\\n\\n0.94\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n\\nt'\\n\\n0.11\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.88\\n\\n\\naime\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.95\\n\\n0.02\\n\\nSometimes, alignment can be multiple-to-multiple. For example, the English phrase look it up corresponds to cherchez-le. Thus, \\\"soft\\\" attention weights work better than \\\"hard\\\" attention weights (setting one attention weight to 1, and the others to 0), as we would like the model to make a context vector consisting of a weighted sum of the hidden vectors, rather than \\\"the best one\\\", as there may not be a best hidden vector.\\nThis view of the attention weights addresses some of the neural network explainability problem. Networks that perform verbatim translation without regard to word order would show the highest scores along the (dominant) diagonal of the matrix. The off-diagonal dominance shows that the attention mechanism is more nuanced. On the first pass through the decoder, 94% of the attention weight is on the first English word I, so the network offers the word je. On the second pass of the decoder, 88% of the attention weight is on the third English word you, so it offers t'. On the last pass, 95% of the attention weight is on the second English word love, so it offers aime.\\n\\nseq2seq[edit]\\nProblem statement[edit]\\nAnimation of seq2seq with RNN and attention mechanism\\nConsider the seq2seq language English-to-French translation task. To be concrete, let us consider the translation of \\\"the zone of international control <end>\\\", which should translate to \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\". Here, we use the special <end> token as a control character to delimit the end of input for both the encoder and the decoder.\\nAn input sequence of text \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nx\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n is processed by a neural network (which can be an LSTM, a Transformer encoder, or some other network) into a sequence of real-valued vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, where \\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\n\\n stands for \\\"hidden vector\\\".\\nAfter the encoder has finished processing, the decoder starts operating over the hidden vectors, to produce an output sequence \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\ny\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle y_{0},y_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, autoregressively. That is, it always takes as input both the hidden vectors produced by the encoder, and what the decoder itself has produced before, to produce the next output word:\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start>\\\") → \\\"la\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la\\\") → \\\"la zone\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone\\\") → \\\"la zone de\\\"\\n...\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone de contrôle international\\\") → \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\"\\nHere, we use the special <start> token as a control character to delimit the start of input for the decoder. The decoding terminates as soon as \\\"<end>\\\" appears in the decoder output.\\n\\nAttention weights[edit]\\nAttention mechanism with attention weights, overview.As hand-crafting weights defeats the purpose of machine learning, the model must compute the attention weights on its own. Taking analogy from the language of database queries, we make the model construct a triple of vectors: key, query, and value. The rough idea is that we have a \\\"database\\\" in the form of a list of key-value pairs. The decoder sends in a query, and obtains a reply in the form of a weighted sum of the values, where the weight is proportional to how closely the query resembles each key.\\nThe decoder first processes the \\\"<start>\\\" input partially, to obtain an intermediate vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}}\\n\\n, the 0th hidden vector of decoder. Then, the intermediate vector is transformed by a linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\\n\\n into a query vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}=h_{0}^{d}W^{Q}}\\n\\n. Meanwhile, the hidden vectors outputted by the encoder are transformed by another linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{K}}\\n\\n into key vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle k_{0}=h_{0}W^{K},k_{1}=h_{1}W^{K},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. The linear maps are useful for providing the model with enough freedom to find the best way to represent the data.\\nNow, the query and keys are compared by taking dot products: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{0}^{T},q_{0}k_{1}^{T},\\\\dots }\\n\\n.

This can be interpreted as saying that the attention weight should be mostly applied to the 0th hidden vector of the encoder, a little to the 1st, and essentially none to the rest.\\nIn order to make a properly weighted sum, we need to transform this list of dot products into a probability distribution over \\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n,\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle 0,1,\\\\dots }\\n---------new doc---------\\n.

This is the \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\".This is the dot-attention mechanism. The particular version described in this section is \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\", as the output context vector is used by the decoder, and the input keys and values come from the encoder, but the query comes from the decoder, thus \\\"cross-attention\\\".\\nMore succinctly, we can write it as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nA\\nt\\nt\\ne\\nn\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n(\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{0}=\\\\mathrm {Attention} (h_{0}^{d}W^{Q},HW^{K},HW^{V})=\\\\mathrm {softmax} ((h_{0}^{d}W^{Q})\\\\;(HW^{K})^{T})(HW^{V})}\\n\\nwhere the matrix \\n\\n\\n\\nH\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle H}\\n\\n is the matrix whose rows are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. Note that the querying vector, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}}\\n\\n, is not necessarily the same as the key-value vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}}\\n\\n. In fact, it is theoretically possible for query, key, and value vectors to all be different, though that is rarely done in practice.\\n\\nVariants[edit]\\nMany variants of attention implement soft weights, such as\\n\\nfast weight programmers, or fast weight controllers (1992).[17] A \\\"slow\\\" neural network outputs the \\\"fast\\\" weights of another neural network through outer products. The slow network learns by gradient descent. It was later renamed as \\\"linearized self-attention\\\".[22]\\nBahdanau-style attention,[41] also referred to as additive attention,\\nLuong-style attention,[42] which is known as multiplicative attention,\\nhighly parallelizable self-attention introduced in 2016 as decomposable attention[31] and successfully used in transformers a year later,\\npositional attention and factorized positional attention.[43]\\nFor convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms can be distinguished by the dimension on which they operate, namely: spatial attention,[44] channel attention,[45] or combinations.[46][47]\\nMuch effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\nThese variants recombine the encoder-side inputs to redistribute those effects to each target output. Often, a correlation-style matrix of dot products provides the re-weighting coefficients.  In the figures below, W is the matrix of context attention weights, similar to the formula in Core Calculations section above.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. encoder-decoder dot product\\n\\n2. encoder-decoder QKV\\n\\n3. encoder-only dot product\\n\\n4. encoder-only QKV\\n\\n5.

For example, H is a matrix of the encoder hidden state—one word per column.\\n\\n\\nS, T\\nS, decoder hidden state; T, target word embedding. In the Pytorch Tutorial variant training phase, T alternates between 2 sources depending on the level of teacher forcing used. T could be the embedding of the network's output word; i.e. embedding(argmax(FC output)). Alternatively with teacher forcing, T could be the embedding of the known correct word which can occur with a constant forcing probability, say 1/2.\\n\\n\\nX, H\\nH, encoder hidden state; X, input word embeddings.\\n\\n\\nW\\nAttention coefficients\\n\\n\\nQw, Kw, Vw, FC\\nWeight matrices for query, key, value respectively.

The dot products are xi * xj in variant #3, hi* sj in variant 1, and column i ( Kw * H ) * column j ( Qw * S ) in variant 2, and column i ( Kw * X ) * column j ( Qw * X ) in variant 4. Variant 5 uses a fully-connected layer to determine the coefficients. If the variant is QKV, then the dot products are normalized by the √d where d is the height of the QKV matrices.\\n\\nSelf-attention[edit]\\nEncoder self-attention, block diagram\\nEncoder self-attention, detailed diagramSelf-attention is essentially the same as cross-attention, except that query, key, and value vectors all come from the same model. Both encoder and decoder can use self-attention, but with subtle differences.\\nFor encoder self-attention, we can start with a simple encoder without self-attention, such as an \\\"embedding layer\\\", which simply converts each input word into a vector by a fixed lookup table. This gives a sequence of hidden vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n.

This can be applied repeatedly, to obtain a multilayered encoder. This is the \\\"encoder self-attention\\\", sometimes called the \\\"all-to-all attention\\\", as the vector at every position can attend to every other.\\n\\nMasking[edit]\\nDecoder self-attention with causal masking, detailed diagramFor decoder self-attention, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because during the autoregressive decoding process, the decoder cannot attend to future outputs that has yet to be decoded.

This attention mechanism is the \\\"causally masked self-attention\\\".\\nOptimizations[edit]\\nFlash attention[edit]\\nThe size of the attention matrix is proportional to the square of the number of input tokens. Therefore, when the input is long, calculating the attention matrix requires a lot of GPU memory. Flash attention is an implementation that reduces the memory needs and increases efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. It achieves this by partitioning the attention computation into smaller blocks that fit into the GPU's faster on-chip memory, reducing the need to store large intermediate matrices and thus lowering memory usage while increasing computational efficiency.[52]\\n\\nMathematical representation[edit]\\nStandard Scaled Dot-Product Attention[edit]\\nFor matrices: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{m\\\\times d_{k}}} ,\\\\mathbf {K} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{k}}} }\\n\\n and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{v}}} }\\n\\n, the scaled dot-product, or QKV attention is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention\\n\\n(\\n\\nQ\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n,\\n\\nV\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\nsoftmax\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\mathbf {V} )={\\\\text{softmax}}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\mathbf {K} ^{T}}{\\\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R} ^{m\\\\times d_{v}}}\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {}^{T}}\\n\\n denotes transpose and the softmax function is applied independently to every row of its argument.

overview\\nAttention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \\\"soft\\\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\\nUnlike \\\"hard\\\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \\\"soft\\\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\nAcademic reviews of the history of the attention mechanism are provided in Niu et al.[1] and Soydaner.[2]\\n---------new doc---------\\nPredecessors[edit]\\nSelective attention in humans had been well studied in neuroscience and cognitive psychology.[3] In 1953, Colin Cherry studied selective attention in the context of audition, known as the cocktail party effect.[4]\\nIn 1958, Donald Broadbent proposed the filter model of attention.[5] Selective attention of vision was studied in the 1960s by George Sperling's partial report paradigm. It was also noticed that saccade control is modulated by cognitive processes, insofar as the eye moves preferentially towards areas of high salience. As the fovea of the eye is small, the eye cannot sharply resolve the entire visual field at once. The use of saccade control allows the eye to quickly scan important features of a scene.[6]\\nThese research developments inspired algorithms such as the Neocognitron and its variants.[7][8] Meanwhile, developments in neural networks had inspired circuit models of biological visual attention.[9][2] One well-cited network from 1998, for example, was inspired by the low-level primate visual system. It produced saliency maps of images using handcrafted (not learned) features, which were then used to guide a second neural network in processing patches of the image in order of reducing saliency.[10]\\nA key aspect of attention mechanism can be written (schematically) as: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n∑\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟨\\n(\\n\\nquery\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n,\\n(\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n⟩\\n(\\n\\nvalue\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum _{i}\\\\langle ({\\\\text{query}})_{i},({\\\\text{key}})_{i}\\\\rangle ({\\\\text{value}})_{i}}\\n\\nwhere the angled brackets denote dot product. This shows that it involves a multiplicative operation. Multiplicative operations within artificial neural networks had been studied under the names of Group Method of Data Handling (1965)[11][12] (where Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials implement multiplicative units or \\\"gates\\\"[13]), higher-order neural networks,[14] multiplication units,[15] sigma-pi units,[16] fast weight controllers,[17] and hyper-networks.[18]\\nIn fast weight controller (Schmidhuber, 1992), one of its two networks has  \\\"fast weights\\\" or \\\"dynamic links\\\" (1981).[19][20][21] A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries.[17] This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.[22] A follow-up paper developed a similar system with active weight changing.[23]\\n\\nRecurrent attention[edit]\\nDuring the deep learning era, attention mechanism was developed to solve similar problems in encoding-decoding.[1]\\nIn machine translation, the seq2seq model, as it was proposed in 2014,[24] would encode an input text into a fixed-length vector, which would then be decoded into an output text. If the input text is long, the fixed-length vector would be unable to carry enough information for accurate decoding. An attention mechanism was proposed to solve this problem.\\nAn image captioning model was proposed in 2015, citing inspiration from the seq2seq model.[25] that would encode an input image into a fixed-length vector. Xu et al (2015),[26] citing Bahdanau et al (2014),[27] applied the attention mechanism as used in the seq2seq model to image captioning.\\n\\nTransformer[edit]\\nSee also: Transformer (deep learning architecture) § History\\nOne problem with seq2seq models was their use of recurrent neural networks, which are not parallelizable as both the encoder and the decoder must process the sequence token-by-token. Decomposable attention[28] attempted to solve this problem by processing the input sequence in parallel, before computing a \\\"soft alignment matrix\\\" (alignment is the terminology used by Bahdanau et al[27]) in order to allow for parallel processing.\\nThe idea of using the attention mechanism for self-attention, instead of in an encoder-decoder (cross-attention), was also proposed during this period, such as in differentiable neural computers[29] and neural Turing machines.[30] It was termed intra-attention[31] where an LSTM is augmented with a memory network as it encodes an input sequence.\\nThese strands of development were brought together in 2017 with the Transformer architecture, published in the Attention Is All You Need paper.\\n\\nOverview[edit]\\nThe attention network was designed to identify high correlations patterns amongst words in a given sentence, assuming that it has learned word correlation patterns from the training data.  This correlation is captured as neuronal weights learned during training with backpropagation.\\nThe diagram shows the Attention forward pass calculating correlations of the word \\\"that\\\" with other words in \\\"See that girl run.\\\"  Given the right weights from training, the network should be able to identify \\\"girl\\\" as a highly correlated word.  Some things to note:\\nThis example focuses on the attention of a single word \\\"that\\\".  In practice, the attention of each word is calculated in parallel to speed up calculations.  Simply changing the lowercase \\\"x\\\" vector to the uppercase \\\"X\\\" matrix will yield the formula for this.\\nSoftmax scaling qWkT / √100 prevents a high variance in qWkT that would allow a single word to excessively dominate the softmax resulting in attention to only one word, as a discrete hard max would do.\\nNotation: the commonly written row-wise softmax formula above assumes that vectors are rows, which runs contrary to the standard math notation of column vectors. More correctly, we should take the transpose of the context vector and use the column-wise softmax, resulting in the more correct form\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\nX\\n\\nW\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n∗\\n\\n[\\n(\\n\\nW\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n∗\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\nx\\n_\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nq\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n]\\n\\ns\\nm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}(XW_{v})^{T}*{[(W_{k}X^{T})*{({\\\\underline {x}}W_{q})^{T}}]_{sm}}\\\\end{aligned}}}\\n\\n.\\nThis attention scheme has been compared to the Query-Key analogy of relational databases.  That comparison suggests an asymmetric role for the Query and Key vectors, where one item of interest (the Query vector \\\"that\\\") is matched against all possible items (the Key vectors of each word in the sentence).   However, both Self and Cross Attentions' parallel calculations matches all tokens of the K matrix with all tokens of the Q matrix; therefore the roles of these vectors are symmetric.  Possibly because the simplistic database analogy is flawed, much effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\n\\nMachine translation[edit]\\nComparison of the data flow in CNN, RNN, and self-attention\\nThe seq2seq method developed in the early 2010s uses two neural networks:  an encoder network converts an input sentence into numerical vectors, and a decoder network converts those vectors to sentences in the target language.  The Attention mechanism was grafted onto this structure in 2014 and shown below.  Later it was refined into the Transformer design (2017).\\n\\nA step-by-step sequence of a language translation\\n\\n\\n\\nEncoder-decoder with attention.[39] Numerical subscripts (100, 300, 500, 9k, 10k) indicate vector sizes while lettered subscripts i and i − 1 indicate time steps.

The recurrent layer has 500 neurons and the fully-connected linear layer has 10k neurons (the size of the target vocabulary).[40]   The linear layer alone has 5 million (500 × 10k) weights – ~10 times more weights than the recurrent layer.\\n\\n\\nscore\\n\\n100-long alignment score\\n\\n\\nw\\n\\n100-long vector attention weight.

In the I love you example above, the second word love is aligned with the third word aime. Stacking soft row vectors together for je, t', and aime yields an alignment matrix:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nlove\\n\\nyou\\n\\n\\nje\\n\\n0.94\\n\\n0.02\\n\\n0.04\\n\\n\\nt'\\n\\n0.11\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n0.88\\n\\n\\naime\\n\\n0.03\\n\\n0.95\\n\\n0.02\\n\\nSometimes, alignment can be multiple-to-multiple. For example, the English phrase look it up corresponds to cherchez-le. Thus, \\\"soft\\\" attention weights work better than \\\"hard\\\" attention weights (setting one attention weight to 1, and the others to 0), as we would like the model to make a context vector consisting of a weighted sum of the hidden vectors, rather than \\\"the best one\\\", as there may not be a best hidden vector.\\nThis view of the attention weights addresses some of the neural network explainability problem. Networks that perform verbatim translation without regard to word order would show the highest scores along the (dominant) diagonal of the matrix. The off-diagonal dominance shows that the attention mechanism is more nuanced. On the first pass through the decoder, 94% of the attention weight is on the first English word I, so the network offers the word je. On the second pass of the decoder, 88% of the attention weight is on the third English word you, so it offers t'. On the last pass, 95% of the attention weight is on the second English word love, so it offers aime.\\n\\nseq2seq[edit]\\nProblem statement[edit]\\nAnimation of seq2seq with RNN and attention mechanism\\nConsider the seq2seq language English-to-French translation task. To be concrete, let us consider the translation of \\\"the zone of international control <end>\\\", which should translate to \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\". Here, we use the special <end> token as a control character to delimit the end of input for both the encoder and the decoder.\\nAn input sequence of text \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nx\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n is processed by a neural network (which can be an LSTM, a Transformer encoder, or some other network) into a sequence of real-valued vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, where \\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\n\\n stands for \\\"hidden vector\\\".\\nAfter the encoder has finished processing, the decoder starts operating over the hidden vectors, to produce an output sequence \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\ny\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle y_{0},y_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, autoregressively. That is, it always takes as input both the hidden vectors produced by the encoder, and what the decoder itself has produced before, to produce the next output word:\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start>\\\") → \\\"la\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la\\\") → \\\"la zone\\\"\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone\\\") → \\\"la zone de\\\"\\n...\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n, \\\"<start> la zone de contrôle international\\\") → \\\"la zone de contrôle international <end>\\\"\\nHere, we use the special <start> token as a control character to delimit the start of input for the decoder. The decoding terminates as soon as \\\"<end>\\\" appears in the decoder output.\\n\\nAttention weights[edit]\\nAttention mechanism with attention weights, overview.As hand-crafting weights defeats the purpose of machine learning, the model must compute the attention weights on its own. Taking analogy from the language of database queries, we make the model construct a triple of vectors: key, query, and value. The rough idea is that we have a \\\"database\\\" in the form of a list of key-value pairs. The decoder sends in a query, and obtains a reply in the form of a weighted sum of the values, where the weight is proportional to how closely the query resembles each key.\\nThe decoder first processes the \\\"<start>\\\" input partially, to obtain an intermediate vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}}\\n\\n, the 0th hidden vector of decoder. Then, the intermediate vector is transformed by a linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{Q}}\\n\\n into a query vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}=h_{0}^{d}W^{Q}}\\n\\n. Meanwhile, the hidden vectors outputted by the encoder are transformed by another linear map \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W^{K}}\\n\\n into key vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle k_{0}=h_{0}W^{K},k_{1}=h_{1}W^{K},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. The linear maps are useful for providing the model with enough freedom to find the best way to represent the data.\\nNow, the query and keys are compared by taking dot products: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{0}^{T},q_{0}k_{1}^{T},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. Ideally, the model should have learned to compute the keys and values, such that \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{0}^{T}}\\n\\n is large, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle q_{0}k_{1}^{T}}\\n\\n is small, and the rest are very small. This can be interpreted as saying that the attention weight should be mostly applied to the 0th hidden vector of the encoder, a little to the 1st, and essentially none to the rest.\\nIn order to make a properly weighted sum, we need to transform this list of dot products into a probability distribution over \\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n,\\n1\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle 0,1,\\\\dots }\\n---------new doc---------\\n. This can be accomplished by the softmax function, thus giving us the attention weights:\\n\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\nw\\n\\n00\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nw\\n\\n01\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n)\\n=\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n(\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nq\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle (w_{00},w_{01},\\\\dots )=\\\\mathrm {softmax} (q_{0}k_{0}^{T},q_{0}k_{1}^{T},\\\\dots )}\\n\\nThis is then used to compute the context vector:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nw\\n\\n00\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nw\\n\\n01\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n+\\n⋯\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{0}=w_{00}v_{0}+w_{01}v_{1}+\\\\cdots }\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nv\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nv\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle v_{0}=h_{0}W^{V},v_{1}=h_{1}W^{V},\\\\dots }\\n\\n are the value vectors, linearly transformed by another matrix to provide the model with freedom to find the best way to represent values.

This is the \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\".This is the dot-attention mechanism. The particular version described in this section is \\\"decoder cross-attention\\\", as the output context vector is used by the decoder, and the input keys and values come from the encoder, but the query comes from the decoder, thus \\\"cross-attention\\\".\\nMore succinctly, we can write it as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nA\\nt\\nt\\ne\\nn\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n,\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\ns\\no\\nf\\nt\\nm\\na\\nx\\n\\n(\\n(\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n)\\n(\\nH\\n\\nW\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{0}=\\\\mathrm {Attention} (h_{0}^{d}W^{Q},HW^{K},HW^{V})=\\\\mathrm {softmax} ((h_{0}^{d}W^{Q})\\\\;(HW^{K})^{T})(HW^{V})}\\n\\nwhere the matrix \\n\\n\\n\\nH\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle H}\\n\\n is the matrix whose rows are \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n. Note that the querying vector, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}}\\n\\n, is not necessarily the same as the key-value vector \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0}}\\n\\n. In fact, it is theoretically possible for query, key, and value vectors to all be different, though that is rarely done in practice.\\n\\nVariants[edit]\\nMany variants of attention implement soft weights, such as\\n\\nfast weight programmers, or fast weight controllers (1992).[17] A \\\"slow\\\" neural network outputs the \\\"fast\\\" weights of another neural network through outer products. The slow network learns by gradient descent. It was later renamed as \\\"linearized self-attention\\\".[22]\\nBahdanau-style attention,[41] also referred to as additive attention,\\nLuong-style attention,[42] which is known as multiplicative attention,\\nhighly parallelizable self-attention introduced in 2016 as decomposable attention[31] and successfully used in transformers a year later,\\npositional attention and factorized positional attention.[43]\\nFor convolutional neural networks, attention mechanisms can be distinguished by the dimension on which they operate, namely: spatial attention,[44] channel attention,[45] or combinations.[46][47]\\nMuch effort has gone into understand Attention further by studying their roles in focused settings, such as in-context learning,[32] masked language tasks,[33] stripped down transformers,[34] bigram statistics,[35] N-gram statistics,[36] pairwise convolutions,[37] and arithmetic factoring.[38]\\nThese variants recombine the encoder-side inputs to redistribute those effects to each target output. Often, a correlation-style matrix of dot products provides the re-weighting coefficients.  In the figures below, W is the matrix of context attention weights, similar to the formula in Core Calculations section above.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. encoder-decoder dot product\\n\\n2. encoder-decoder QKV\\n\\n3. encoder-only dot product\\n\\n4. encoder-only QKV\\n\\n5.

In the Pytorch Tutorial variant training phase, T alternates between 2 sources depending on the level of teacher forcing used.

Alternatively with teacher forcing, T could be the embedding of the known correct word which can occur with a constant forcing probability, say 1/2.\\n\\n\\nX, H\\nH, encoder hidden state; X, input word embeddings.\\n\\n\\nW\\nAttention coefficients\\n\\n\\nQw, Kw, Vw, FC\\nWeight matrices for query, key, value respectively.

Variant 5 uses a fully-connected layer to determine the coefficients. If the variant is QKV, then the dot products are normalized by the √d where d is the height of the QKV matrices.\\n\\nSelf-attention[edit]\\nEncoder self-attention, block diagram\\nEncoder self-attention, detailed diagramSelf-attention is essentially the same as cross-attention, except that query, key, and value vectors all come from the same model. Both encoder and decoder can use self-attention, but with subtle differences.\\nFor encoder self-attention, we can start with a simple encoder without self-attention, such as an \\\"embedding layer\\\", which simply converts each input word into a vector by a fixed lookup table. This gives a sequence of hidden vectors \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nh\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n,\\n…\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\\\\dots }\\n\\n.

This can be applied repeatedly, to obtain a multilayered encoder. This is the \\\"encoder self-attention\\\", sometimes called the \\\"all-to-all attention\\\", as the vector at every position can attend to every other.\\n\\nMasking[edit]\\nDecoder self-attention with causal masking, detailed diagramFor decoder self-attention, all-to-all attention is inappropriate, because during the autoregressive decoding process, the decoder cannot attend to future outputs that has yet to be decoded.

This attention mechanism is the \\\"causally masked self-attention\\\".\\nOptimizations[edit]\\nFlash attention[edit]\\nThe size of the attention matrix is proportional to the square of the number of input tokens. Therefore, when the input is long, calculating the attention matrix requires a lot of GPU memory. Flash attention is an implementation that reduces the memory needs and increases efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. It achieves this by partitioning the attention computation into smaller blocks that fit into the GPU's faster on-chip memory, reducing the need to store large intermediate matrices and thus lowering memory usage while increasing computational efficiency.[52]\\n\\nMathematical representation[edit]\\nStandard Scaled Dot-Product Attention[edit]\\nFor matrices: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{m\\\\times d_{k}}} ,\\\\mathbf {K} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{k}}} }\\n\\n and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\nn\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R^{n\\\\times d_{v}}} }\\n\\n, the scaled dot-product, or QKV attention is defined as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttention\\n\\n(\\n\\nQ\\n\\n,\\n\\nK\\n\\n,\\n\\nV\\n\\n)\\n=\\n\\nsoftmax\\n\\n\\n(\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n∈\\n\\n\\nR\\n\\n\\nm\\n×\\n\\nd\\n\\nv\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{Attention}}(\\\\mathbf {Q} ,\\\\mathbf {K} ,\\\\mathbf {V} )={\\\\text{softmax}}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\mathbf {Q} \\\\mathbf {K} ^{T}}{\\\\sqrt {d_{k}}}}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf {V} \\\\in \\\\mathbb {R} ^{m\\\\times d_{v}}}\\n\\n\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {}^{T}}\\n\\n denotes transpose and the softmax function is applied independently to every row of its argument.
