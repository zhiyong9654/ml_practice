Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \\\"dark\\\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \\\"dark\\\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Most of the task-specific labeled data comes from human annotation, such as classification task or RLHF labeling (which can be constructed as classification format) for LLM alignment training. Lots of ML techniques in the post can help with data quality, but fundamentally human data collection involves attention to details and careful execution. The community knows the value of high quality data, but somehow we have this subtle impression that “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work” (Sambasivan et al. 2021).\\n\\nFig. 1. Two directions to approach high data quality.\\nHuman Raters ↔ Data Quality#\\nCollecting human data involve a set of operation steps and every step contributes to the data quality:\\n\\nTask design: Design task workflow to improve clarity and reduce complexity. Detailed guidelines are helpful but very long and complicated guidelines demand a decent amount of training to be useful.\\nSelect and train a pool of raters: Select annotators with matched skillset and consistency. Training sessions are necessary. After onboarding, regular feedback and calibration sessions are also needed.\\nCollect and aggregate data. This is the stage where more ML techniques can be applied to clean, filter and smartly aggregate data to identify the true labels.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. Quality assurance refers to a set of actions that allow one to improve quality by acting on the quality attributes identified in the quality model. (Image source: Daniel et al. 2018)\\nThe Wisdom of the Crowd#\\nVox populi (originally “Vox populi, vox Dei”), a Latin phrase, means the voice of people. A short paper named was the same name was published in 1907 on Nature. It tracked an event at an annual exhibition where a fat ox was selected and people would guess the weight of the ox in order to win a prize if the guess is close to the real number. The middlemost estimate was treated as “the vox populi” and ended up being very close to the true value. The author concluded “This result is, I think, more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.” This is probably the earliest mention of how crowdsourcing (“the wisdom of the crowd”) would work out.\\nAlmost 100 years later, Callison-Burch (2009) did an early study on using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to run non-expert human evaluation on Machine Translation (MT) tasks and even to rely on non-experts to create new gold reference translations. The setup for human evaluation was simple: Each turker is shown a source sentence, a reference translation, and 5 translations from 5 MT systems. They are asked to rank 5 translations from best to worst. Each task is completed by 5 turkers.\\nUnsurprisingly, there are spammers producing low quality annotation to only optimize the volume. So when measuring the agreement between experts and non-experts, different weighting schemes need to be applied to downweight the contribution of spammers: (1) “weighted by experts”: using agreement rate with experts on a gold set of 10 examples; (2) “weighted by non-experts”: relying on agreement rate with the rest of turkers on the whole dataset.\\nIn a harder task, non-expert human annotators were asked to create new gold reference translations. Callison-Burch designed the task in two stages, where the first stage created new translations with reference to MT outputs and the second one filtered translations that may seem to be gerated by a MT system. The correlation between experts’ and crowdsourced translations is higher than that between expert and MT system outputs.\\n\\nFig. 3. (Left) The agreement rate is measured by comparing each pair of translation sentences (\\\"A > B\\\", \\\"A=B\\\", \\\"A < B\\\") and thus chance agreement is 1/3. The upper bound is set by the expert-expert agreement rate. (Right) Comparison of BLEU score between translations from different sources. LCD (Linguistic Data Consortium) translators provide expert translations. (Image source: Callison-Burch 2009)\\nRater Agreement#\\nWe often think of annotation as targeting a single ground truth and try to evaluate quality against one gold answer with consistent standards. A common practice for finding reliable ground truth labels is to collect multiple labels from multiple raters. Assuming that each rater performs at a different level of quality, we can use a weighted average of annotations but weighted by a proficiency score. This score is often approximated by how often one rater agrees with others.\\nMajority Voting: Taking the majority vote is the simplest way of aggregation, equivalent to taking the mode of a set of labels. In this setting, every annotator is contributing equally.\\nRaw agreement (Tratz & Hovy, 2010): Raw agreement counts the percentage of other people agreeing with them. This is indirectly correlated to majority vote, because all members of the majority class are expected to get higher inter-annotator agreement rate.\\nCohen’s Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977): Cohen’s kappa measures the inter-rater agreement in the form of $\\\\kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_c)$, where $p_o$ is the raw agreement rate and $p_e$ is the agreement by chance. Cohen’s kappa has a correction term for agreeing by chance, but this correction may be overestimated if one label is more prevalent.\\nProbabilistic Graph Modeling: There is a body of work relying on probabilistic graph modeling to model different factors within annotation decisions, e.g. difficulty of the task, task latent topics, rater bias, rater confidence, and then predict the true labels accordingly. Zheng et al. (2017)  compared 17 algorithms on truth inference in crowdsourcing and most of them are probabilistic graph models.\\n\\nMACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation; Hovy et al. 2013) is an early example of using graph modeling to estimate the likelihood of someone acting like a “spammer” by providing random labels. Unsurprisingly in cases when the incentive is misaligned, some annotators may behave as “spammers” to optimize the volume of tasks completed for higher pay. The goal of MACE is to identify spammers. Given a task $i$ and an annotator $j$, $T_i$ is the true label, $A_{ij}$ is the assigned label and $S_{ij}$ models the probability of annotator $j$ spamming. Then the generative process can be represented as belows. The parameter $\\\\theta_j$ defines the trustworthiness of the annotator $j$ (probability of not spamming) and the parameter $\\\\xi_j$  defines how an annotator behaves when they are spamming.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n& \\\\text{for } i = 1 \\\\dots N : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad T_i \\\\sim \\\\text{Uniform} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\text{for } j = 1 \\\\dots M : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad S_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(1 - \\\\theta_j) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{if } S_{ij} = 0 : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} = T_i \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{else } : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Multinomial}(\\\\xi_j) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can learn $\\\\theta, \\\\xi$ to maximize the observed data, in the form of the marginal data likelihood, where $A$ is the matrix of annotations, $S$ is the matrix of competence indicators and $T$ is the matrix of true labels:\\n\\n$$\\nP(A; \\\\theta, \\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{T, S} \\\\big[ \\\\prod_{i=1}^N P(T_i) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{j=1}^M P(S_{ij}; \\\\theta_j) \\\\cdot P(A_{ij} \\\\vert S_{ij}, T_i; \\\\xi_j) \\\\big]\\n$$\\n\\nEither EM (Expectation–maximization) or VB (Variational Bayes) can be applied to maximize the above marginal likelihood. During EM optimization, at M-step, a fixed value $\\\\delta$ is added to the fractional counts before normalizing. During VB training, they applied symmetric Beta priors on $\\\\theta_j$  and symmetric Dirichlet priors on $\\\\xi_j$. When recovering the correct answers, we can take majority vote weighted by the annotators’ $\\\\theta$ estimates.\\nRater Disagreement & Two Paradigms#\\nThe aggregation process described above depends on an assumption that there exists one underlying gold answer and thus we can evaluate annotators’ performance accordingly. However, in many topics, especially in safety, social, or cultural areas, people can disagree and often this disagreement is valid and then it comes down to how much we want to apply a strict rule versus embracing diversity.\\nAroyo & Welty (2015) discussed a set of “myths” in the practice of human annotation collection and found all of them somewhat inaccurate, key findings including:\\n\\nOften there is more than one correct interpretation for some samples. We need diverse perspectives via e.g. having multiple people to review annotation quality.\\nDisagreement is not always bad. We should reduce disagreements caused by errors or poorly designed process but other disagreements can give us rich information.\\n\\nIf it is caused by a task not well defined, we should enhance the instruction. However, a more detailed guideline does not resolve innate diversity among opinions.\\n\\n\\nExperts may not always be better than lay people, but they would have a big gap in terms of considering what’s important.\\nGround truth annotations can change in time, especially those related to timely events or news.\\n\\nLater, Rottger et al. (2021) formulated the difference into two contrasting paradigms for data annotation for subjective NLP tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDescriptive\\nPrescriptive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinition\\nEncourage annotator subjectivity, trying to model many beliefs.\\nDiscourage annotator subjectivity, trying to consistently apply one belief.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n- Can help to identify which entries are more subjective;- Embrace diversity\\n- More aligned with standard NLP setup. - Easier to do QC by measuring disagreement or doing label aggregation.\\n\\n\\nCons\\n- Metrics like rater disagreement cannot be used to measure data quality or annotator performance; - Cannot be used for training models that are optimized for outputting one preset behavior.\\n- Expensive and challenging to create high-quality annotation guidelines, which can never be perfect, in practice;- Training annotators to get familiar with guideline in order to apply it properly is also challenging;- Cannot capture an interpretable diversity of beliefs or consistently encode one specific belief.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe descriptive paradigm allows us to understand a number of important effects as well as to account for different perspectives. For example, annotator identity (e.g. African American, LGBTQ) is found to be a statistically significant factor in how they would label identify-related content as toxic (Goyal et al. 2022). Topics can be another main driver for diverse opinions. Wang et al. (2023) studied the human evaluation process of safety of an AI conversation system and compared results between labels by Trust & Safety (T&S) professionals and crowdsourcing annotators. They intentionally collected rich metadata associated with crowd annotators like demographic or behavior information. Comparing T&S expert labels and crowd annotations, they found that agreement rates vary across semantic topics and the level of severity:\\n\\nAgreement rate differs a lot across different topics; ranging from 0.96 on violence/gory to 0.25 on personal topics.\\nAgreement rates are higher on “extreme” and “benign” conversations, given four label options marking “benign”, “debatable”, “moderate” to “extreme”.\\n\\n\\nFig. 4. Correlations between non-expert and expert annotations vary a lot across topics. (Image source: Wang et al. 2023)\\nZhang et al. (2023) proposed a taxonomy of rater disagreement to analyze the root causes. Among the listed causes, disagreement due to stochastic errors or inconsistency on the individual level should be avoided. In cases when a rater gives different labels to the same task when asked multiple times, some of those are most likely caused by human errors. Based on this intuition, the disagreement deconvolution method (Gordon et al. 2021) disentangles stable opinions from errors by anchoring each individual’s opinion to their own primary label and thus encouraging intra-rater consistency.\\n\\nFig. 5. A taxonomy of causes for rater disagreement. (Image source: Zhang et al. 2023)\\nDisagreement deconvolution relies on probabilistic graph modeling:\\n\\nEstimate how often an annotator returns non-primary labels, $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nPer sample, get an adjusted label distribution $p^*$ of primary labels based on $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nSample from $p^*$ as a new test set.\\nMeasure performance metrics against the new test set.\\n\\nGiven $C$-category classification, the sampling process of the generative model is stated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ny^*\\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C], p^*(y\\\\mid x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny_\\\\text{other}\\\\mid y^* &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C]\\\\setminus\\\\{y^*\\\\}, \\\\frac{1}{C-1}) \\\\\\\\\\nz_\\\\text{flip} \\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(p_\\\\text{flip}(x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny\\\\mid y^*, y_\\\\text{other}, z_\\\\text{flip} &= y^* (1 - z_\\\\text{flip}) + y_\\\\text{other} z_\\\\text{flip}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nGiven the true $p(y\\\\mid x)$ and $p_\\\\text{flip}$ that can be estimated from the data, we would update the label distribution of primary labels:\\n\\n$$\\np^*(y\\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{p(y\\\\mid x) - \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C-1}}{1 - \\\\frac{C \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C - 1}}\\n$$\\n\\nA new test set sampled from $p^*(y \\\\mid x)$ represents the primary labels with individual inconsistency noise removed. It can be used for evaluation, as a noise-free test set.\\nTo capture systematic disagreement among annotators when learning to predict labels, Davani et al. (2021) experimented with a multi-annotator model where predicting each annotator’s labels is treated as one sub-task. Say, the classification task is defined on an annotated dataset $D=(X, A, Y)$, where $X$ is the text instances, $A$ is the set of annotators and $Y$ is the annotation matrix, $y_{ij} \\\\in Y$ represents a binary label assigned by $a_j \\\\in A$ to the sample $x_i \\\\in X$. The majority vote for $x_i$ is denoted as $\\\\bar{y}_{i,}$. The experiment is to train a classification head on top of a pre-trained BERT model and compares 4 setups:\\n\\nBaseline: Directly predict the majority vote $\\\\bar{y}_i$, not using the full annotation matrix $Y$.\\nEnsemble: Train one model per annotator separately to predict $y_{ij}$ and then the results are aggregated by majority vote.\\nMulti-label: Learn to predict $\\\\vert A \\\\vert$ labels to represent all annotators’ labels per sample $\\\\langle y_{i1}, \\\\dots, y_{i\\\\vert A \\\\vert} \\\\rangle$, with a shared MLP layer and then outputs are aggregated.\\nMulti-task: Similar to multi-label, but each annotator’s prediction head is learned from a separated MLP layer, such that we allocate extra compute to learn the difference among annotators.\\n\\nExperiment results on the GHC (Gab Hate Corpus) dataset showed that the multi-task model achieves the best F1 score and also can naturally provide prediction uncertainty estimation, correlated with annotation disagreement.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of different architectures for modeling multiple annotators' labels. (Image source: Davani et al. 2021)\\nJury Learning (Gordon et al. 2022) mimics the jury process by modeling the different annotators’ labeling behavior conditioned on their characteristics. Starting with a dataset with labels and demographic characteristics of each labeler, we train a model to learn to predict labels made by every individual annotator, each as a potential juror. At decision time, practitioners can specify the composition of a group of jurors to determine a sampling strategy. The final decision is made by aggregating labels from jurors from multiple trials.\\n\\nFig. 7. Illustration of how jury learning works. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nThe jury learning model is a DCN (Deep & Cross network) , commonly for recommendation use case,  that is jointly trained to learn comment embedding, annotator embedding and group (annotator’s characteristics) embedding. The text content is processed by a pre-trained BERT, which is also jointly fine-tuned but for a shorter period to avoid overfitting.\\n\\nFig. 8. DCN model architecture for jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nTheir experiment runs on the toxicity diversity dataset and compares jury learning with a baseline model which is a fine-tuned BERT to predict individual annotator’s label without using metadata. Performance is measured in MAE (mean absolute error). Jury learning consistently outperforms the annotator-agnostic baseline on the full test set as well as each group segment.\\n\\nFig. 9. Experiment results comparing an annotator-agnostic baseline with jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nData Quality ↔ Model Training#\\nOnce a dataset is constructed, many methods can help identify mislabels according to the training dynamics. Note that we only focus on methods to find and exclude data points with potentially incorrect labels, not about how to train a model with noisy data.\\nInfluence Functions#\\nInfluence functions is a classic technique from robust statistics (Hampel, 1974) to measure the effect of training data points by describing how the model parameters change as we upweight a training point by an infinitesimal amount. Koh & Liang (2017) introduced the concept to be applied to deep neural networks.\\nGiven $n$ data samples in the train set, $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$ for $i =1, \\\\dots, n$, The model parameter $\\\\theta$ is optimized to minimize a loss: $\\\\hat{\\\\theta} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. The change of model parameters after we remove a single data point $z$ is denoted as $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{z_i \\\\neq z} \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. However, computing this literally for every sample is too expensive. One way to approximate this is to compute the parameter change given a small upweight $\\\\epsilon$ on $z$. By definition, the influence of upweighting $z$ by $\\\\epsilon$ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z) = \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0}=-\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta) + \\\\epsilon L(z, \\\\theta)$ and $\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\nabla^2_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$.\\nRemoving a data point $x$ is equivalent to upweighting it by $\\\\epsilon = -\\\\frac{1}{n}$ and therefore $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\approx -\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z)$.\\nThe influence of upweighting $z$ on the loss at a test point $z_\\\\text{test}$ is given by applying the chain rule:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z, z_\\\\text{test}) \\n&= \\\\frac{d \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z})}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\frac{d \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= - \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the influence function we can measure the effect of a single data point on model parameters and loss function in closed forms. It can help approximate leave-one-out retraining without actually running all the retraining. To identify mislabeled data, we can measure $\\\\mathcal{I}_\\\\text{up,loss}(z_i, z_i)$, approximating the prediction error on $z_i$ if $z_i$ is removed from the training set.\\n\\nFig. 10. Influence functions values match leave-one-out training results on 10-class MNIST. (Image source: Kohn & Liang, 2017)\\nGiven the closed form, influence functions is still hard to be scaled up because the inverse Hessian vector product is hard to compute. Grosse et al. (2023) experimented with the EK-FAC (Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature; George et al. 2018) approximation instead.\\nPrediction Changes during Training#\\nAnother branch of methods are to track the changes of model prediction during training to identify cases which seem hard to be learned. Data Maps (Swayamdipta et al. 2020) tracks two attributes of model behavior dynamics during training to analyze the quality of dataset:\\n\\nConfidence: The model’s confidence in the true label, defined as the mean model probability of the true label across epochs. They also used a coarse-grained metric, “correctness”, defined as the fraction of times when the model predicts the correct label across epochs.\\nVariability: The variation of the confidence, defined as the standard deviation of model probability of the true label across epochs.\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Data map for SNLI training set, based on a RoBERTa classifier. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more likely to be mislabeled. They ran an experiment on WinoGrande dataset with 1% flipped label data. After retraining, flipped instances move to the lower confidence and slightly higher variability regions, indicating that the hard-to-learn regions contains mislabeled samples. Given this, we can train a classifier on equal numbers of label flipped and clean samples using only the confidence score (unsure why the paper didn’t use both confidence and variability as features). This simple noise classifier then can be used on the original dataset to identify potentially mislabeled instances.\\n\\nFig. 12. Data points originally with high confidence and low variability scores moved to low confidence, slightly higher variability regions after labels get flipped. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHowever, we should not consider all hard-to-learn samples to be incorrect. In fact, the paper hypothesizes that ambiguous (high variability) and hard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more informative for learning. Experiments showed that they are good for OOD generalization, giving better results on OOD eval, even in comparison to 100% training set.\\nTo investigate whether neural networks have a tendency to forget previously learned information, Toneva et al. (2019) designed an experiment: They track the model prediction for each sample during the training process and count the transitions for each sample from being classified correctly to incorrectly or vice-versa. Then samples can be categorized accordingly,\\n\\nForgettable (redundant) samples: If the class label changes across training epochs.\\nUnforgettable samples: If the class label assignment is consistent across training epochs. Those samples are never forgotten once learned.\\n\\nThey found that there are a large number of unforgettable examples that are never forgotten once learnt. Examples with noisy labels or images with “uncommon” features (visually complicated to classify) are among the most forgotten examples. The experiments empirically validated that unforgettable examples can be safely removed without compromising model performance.\\nIn the implementation, the forgetting event is only counted when a sample is included in the current training batch; that is, they compute forgetting across presentations of the same example in subsequent mini-batches. The number of forgetting events per sample is quite stable across different seeds and forgettable examples have a small tendency to be first-time learned later in the training. The forgetting events are also found to be transferable throughout the training period and between architectures.\\nPleiss, et al. (2020) developed a method named AUM (Area under the Margin) to spot wrong labels based on such an assumption: Say, a BIRD image is mistakenly marked as DOG. The gradient update would encourage generalization from other BIRD images to this BIRD image, while the DOG label provides an incorrect supervised signal to encourage the update to go another way. Hence, there exists tension between generalization and (wrong) prediction in gradient update signals.\\nGiven a classification dataset $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}$, let $z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ be the logit corresponding to class $i$ at epoch $t$. The margin at epoch $t$ is the difference between the assigned logit and the next largest logit:\\n\\n$$\\nM^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = z_y^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\max_{i \\\\neq y} z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{AUM}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^T_{t=1} M^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)\\n$$\\n\\nA negative margin indicates a wrong prediction and a large positive margin suggests high confidence in a correct prediction. The hypothesis is that mislabeled samples would have a smaller margin than correct samples due to the tension of generalization via SGD triggered by other samples.\\nIn order to determine the threshold, they insert fake data, named “threshold samples”, to determine the threshold:\\n\\nCreate a subset of threshold samples $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}$.  If there are $N$ training samples for $C$ classes, we randomly sample $N/(C+1)$ samples and switch all their labels to a fake new class $C+1$.\\nMerge threshold samples into the original dataset: $\\\\mathcal{D}’ = { (\\\\mathbf{x}, C+1): \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}} \\\\cup (\\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr})$;\\nTrain the model on $\\\\mathcal{D}’$ and measure AUM of all the data;\\nCompute the threshold $\\\\alpha$ as the 99th percentile of AUM of threshold samples;\\nIdentify mislabeled data using $\\\\alpha$ a threshold: ${(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}: \\\\text{AUM}_{\\\\mathbf{x}, y} \\\\leq \\\\alpha}$\\n\\n\\nFig. 13.

Clean samples are expected to be more trustworthy. INCV (Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation) runs NCV iteratively where more clean samples are added into the trusted candidate set $\\\\mathcal{C}$ and more noisy samples are removed.\\n\\nFig. 15.

Most of the task-specific labeled data comes from human annotation, such as classification task or RLHF labeling (which can be constructed as classification format) for LLM alignment training. Lots of ML techniques in the post can help with data quality, but fundamentally human data collection involves attention to details and careful execution. The community knows the value of high quality data, but somehow we have this subtle impression that “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work” (Sambasivan et al. 2021).\\n\\nFig. 1. Two directions to approach high data quality.\\nHuman Raters ↔ Data Quality#\\nCollecting human data involve a set of operation steps and every step contributes to the data quality:\\n\\nTask design: Design task workflow to improve clarity and reduce complexity. Detailed guidelines are helpful but very long and complicated guidelines demand a decent amount of training to be useful.\\nSelect and train a pool of raters: Select annotators with matched skillset and consistency. Training sessions are necessary. After onboarding, regular feedback and calibration sessions are also needed.\\nCollect and aggregate data. This is the stage where more ML techniques can be applied to clean, filter and smartly aggregate data to identify the true labels.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. Quality assurance refers to a set of actions that allow one to improve quality by acting on the quality attributes identified in the quality model. (Image source: Daniel et al. 2018)\\nThe Wisdom of the Crowd#\\nVox populi (originally “Vox populi, vox Dei”), a Latin phrase, means the voice of people. A short paper named was the same name was published in 1907 on Nature. It tracked an event at an annual exhibition where a fat ox was selected and people would guess the weight of the ox in order to win a prize if the guess is close to the real number. The middlemost estimate was treated as “the vox populi” and ended up being very close to the true value. The author concluded “This result is, I think, more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.” This is probably the earliest mention of how crowdsourcing (“the wisdom of the crowd”) would work out.\\nAlmost 100 years later, Callison-Burch (2009) did an early study on using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to run non-expert human evaluation on Machine Translation (MT) tasks and even to rely on non-experts to create new gold reference translations. The setup for human evaluation was simple: Each turker is shown a source sentence, a reference translation, and 5 translations from 5 MT systems. They are asked to rank 5 translations from best to worst. Each task is completed by 5 turkers.\\nUnsurprisingly, there are spammers producing low quality annotation to only optimize the volume. So when measuring the agreement between experts and non-experts, different weighting schemes need to be applied to downweight the contribution of spammers: (1) “weighted by experts”: using agreement rate with experts on a gold set of 10 examples; (2) “weighted by non-experts”: relying on agreement rate with the rest of turkers on the whole dataset.\\nIn a harder task, non-expert human annotators were asked to create new gold reference translations. Callison-Burch designed the task in two stages, where the first stage created new translations with reference to MT outputs and the second one filtered translations that may seem to be gerated by a MT system. The correlation between experts’ and crowdsourced translations is higher than that between expert and MT system outputs.\\n\\nFig. 3. (Left) The agreement rate is measured by comparing each pair of translation sentences (\\\"A > B\\\", \\\"A=B\\\", \\\"A < B\\\") and thus chance agreement is 1/3. The upper bound is set by the expert-expert agreement rate. (Right) Comparison of BLEU score between translations from different sources. LCD (Linguistic Data Consortium) translators provide expert translations. (Image source: Callison-Burch 2009)\\nRater Agreement#\\nWe often think of annotation as targeting a single ground truth and try to evaluate quality against one gold answer with consistent standards. A common practice for finding reliable ground truth labels is to collect multiple labels from multiple raters. Assuming that each rater performs at a different level of quality, we can use a weighted average of annotations but weighted by a proficiency score. This score is often approximated by how often one rater agrees with others.\\nMajority Voting: Taking the majority vote is the simplest way of aggregation, equivalent to taking the mode of a set of labels. In this setting, every annotator is contributing equally.\\nRaw agreement (Tratz & Hovy, 2010): Raw agreement counts the percentage of other people agreeing with them. This is indirectly correlated to majority vote, because all members of the majority class are expected to get higher inter-annotator agreement rate.\\nCohen’s Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977): Cohen’s kappa measures the inter-rater agreement in the form of $\\\\kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_c)$, where $p_o$ is the raw agreement rate and $p_e$ is the agreement by chance. Cohen’s kappa has a correction term for agreeing by chance, but this correction may be overestimated if one label is more prevalent.\\nProbabilistic Graph Modeling: There is a body of work relying on probabilistic graph modeling to model different factors within annotation decisions, e.g. difficulty of the task, task latent topics, rater bias, rater confidence, and then predict the true labels accordingly. Zheng et al. (2017)  compared 17 algorithms on truth inference in crowdsourcing and most of them are probabilistic graph models.\\n\\nMACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation; Hovy et al. 2013) is an early example of using graph modeling to estimate the likelihood of someone acting like a “spammer” by providing random labels. Unsurprisingly in cases when the incentive is misaligned, some annotators may behave as “spammers” to optimize the volume of tasks completed for higher pay. The goal of MACE is to identify spammers. Given a task $i$ and an annotator $j$, $T_i$ is the true label, $A_{ij}$ is the assigned label and $S_{ij}$ models the probability of annotator $j$ spamming. Then the generative process can be represented as belows. The parameter $\\\\theta_j$ defines the trustworthiness of the annotator $j$ (probability of not spamming) and the parameter $\\\\xi_j$  defines how an annotator behaves when they are spamming.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n& \\\\text{for } i = 1 \\\\dots N : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad T_i \\\\sim \\\\text{Uniform} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\text{for } j = 1 \\\\dots M : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad S_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(1 - \\\\theta_j) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{if } S_{ij} = 0 : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} = T_i \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{else } : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Multinomial}(\\\\xi_j) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can learn $\\\\theta, \\\\xi$ to maximize the observed data, in the form of the marginal data likelihood, where $A$ is the matrix of annotations, $S$ is the matrix of competence indicators and $T$ is the matrix of true labels:\\n\\n$$\\nP(A; \\\\theta, \\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{T, S} \\\\big[ \\\\prod_{i=1}^N P(T_i) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{j=1}^M P(S_{ij}; \\\\theta_j) \\\\cdot P(A_{ij} \\\\vert S_{ij}, T_i; \\\\xi_j) \\\\big]\\n$$\\n\\nEither EM (Expectation–maximization) or VB (Variational Bayes) can be applied to maximize the above marginal likelihood. During EM optimization, at M-step, a fixed value $\\\\delta$ is added to the fractional counts before normalizing. During VB training, they applied symmetric Beta priors on $\\\\theta_j$  and symmetric Dirichlet priors on $\\\\xi_j$. When recovering the correct answers, we can take majority vote weighted by the annotators’ $\\\\theta$ estimates.\\nRater Disagreement & Two Paradigms#\\nThe aggregation process described above depends on an assumption that there exists one underlying gold answer and thus we can evaluate annotators’ performance accordingly. However, in many topics, especially in safety, social, or cultural areas, people can disagree and often this disagreement is valid and then it comes down to how much we want to apply a strict rule versus embracing diversity.\\nAroyo & Welty (2015) discussed a set of “myths” in the practice of human annotation collection and found all of them somewhat inaccurate, key findings including:\\n\\nOften there is more than one correct interpretation for some samples. We need diverse perspectives via e.g. having multiple people to review annotation quality.\\nDisagreement is not always bad. We should reduce disagreements caused by errors or poorly designed process but other disagreements can give us rich information.\\n\\nIf it is caused by a task not well defined, we should enhance the instruction. However, a more detailed guideline does not resolve innate diversity among opinions.\\n\\n\\nExperts may not always be better than lay people, but they would have a big gap in terms of considering what’s important.\\nGround truth annotations can change in time, especially those related to timely events or news.\\n\\nLater, Rottger et al. (2021) formulated the difference into two contrasting paradigms for data annotation for subjective NLP tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDescriptive\\nPrescriptive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinition\\nEncourage annotator subjectivity, trying to model many beliefs.\\nDiscourage annotator subjectivity, trying to consistently apply one belief.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n- Can help to identify which entries are more subjective;- Embrace diversity\\n- More aligned with standard NLP setup. - Easier to do QC by measuring disagreement or doing label aggregation.\\n\\n\\nCons\\n- Metrics like rater disagreement cannot be used to measure data quality or annotator performance; - Cannot be used for training models that are optimized for outputting one preset behavior.\\n- Expensive and challenging to create high-quality annotation guidelines, which can never be perfect, in practice;- Training annotators to get familiar with guideline in order to apply it properly is also challenging;- Cannot capture an interpretable diversity of beliefs or consistently encode one specific belief.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe descriptive paradigm allows us to understand a number of important effects as well as to account for different perspectives. For example, annotator identity (e.g. African American, LGBTQ) is found to be a statistically significant factor in how they would label identify-related content as toxic (Goyal et al. 2022). Topics can be another main driver for diverse opinions. Wang et al. (2023) studied the human evaluation process of safety of an AI conversation system and compared results between labels by Trust & Safety (T&S) professionals and crowdsourcing annotators. They intentionally collected rich metadata associated with crowd annotators like demographic or behavior information. Comparing T&S expert labels and crowd annotations, they found that agreement rates vary across semantic topics and the level of severity:\\n\\nAgreement rate differs a lot across different topics; ranging from 0.96 on violence/gory to 0.25 on personal topics.\\nAgreement rates are higher on “extreme” and “benign” conversations, given four label options marking “benign”, “debatable”, “moderate” to “extreme”.\\n\\n\\nFig. 4. Correlations between non-expert and expert annotations vary a lot across topics. (Image source: Wang et al. 2023)\\nZhang et al. (2023) proposed a taxonomy of rater disagreement to analyze the root causes. Among the listed causes, disagreement due to stochastic errors or inconsistency on the individual level should be avoided. In cases when a rater gives different labels to the same task when asked multiple times, some of those are most likely caused by human errors. Based on this intuition, the disagreement deconvolution method (Gordon et al. 2021) disentangles stable opinions from errors by anchoring each individual’s opinion to their own primary label and thus encouraging intra-rater consistency.\\n\\nFig. 5. A taxonomy of causes for rater disagreement. (Image source: Zhang et al. 2023)\\nDisagreement deconvolution relies on probabilistic graph modeling:\\n\\nEstimate how often an annotator returns non-primary labels, $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nPer sample, get an adjusted label distribution $p^*$ of primary labels based on $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nSample from $p^*$ as a new test set.\\nMeasure performance metrics against the new test set.\\n\\nGiven $C$-category classification, the sampling process of the generative model is stated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ny^*\\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C], p^*(y\\\\mid x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny_\\\\text{other}\\\\mid y^* &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C]\\\\setminus\\\\{y^*\\\\}, \\\\frac{1}{C-1}) \\\\\\\\\\nz_\\\\text{flip} \\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(p_\\\\text{flip}(x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny\\\\mid y^*, y_\\\\text{other}, z_\\\\text{flip} &= y^* (1 - z_\\\\text{flip}) + y_\\\\text{other} z_\\\\text{flip}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nGiven the true $p(y\\\\mid x)$ and $p_\\\\text{flip}$ that can be estimated from the data, we would update the label distribution of primary labels:\\n\\n$$\\np^*(y\\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{p(y\\\\mid x) - \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C-1}}{1 - \\\\frac{C \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C - 1}}\\n$$\\n\\nA new test set sampled from $p^*(y \\\\mid x)$ represents the primary labels with individual inconsistency noise removed. It can be used for evaluation, as a noise-free test set.\\nTo capture systematic disagreement among annotators when learning to predict labels, Davani et al. (2021) experimented with a multi-annotator model where predicting each annotator’s labels is treated as one sub-task. Say, the classification task is defined on an annotated dataset $D=(X, A, Y)$, where $X$ is the text instances, $A$ is the set of annotators and $Y$ is the annotation matrix, $y_{ij} \\\\in Y$ represents a binary label assigned by $a_j \\\\in A$ to the sample $x_i \\\\in X$. The majority vote for $x_i$ is denoted as $\\\\bar{y}_{i,}$. The experiment is to train a classification head on top of a pre-trained BERT model and compares 4 setups:\\n\\nBaseline: Directly predict the majority vote $\\\\bar{y}_i$, not using the full annotation matrix $Y$.\\nEnsemble: Train one model per annotator separately to predict $y_{ij}$ and then the results are aggregated by majority vote.\\nMulti-label: Learn to predict $\\\\vert A \\\\vert$ labels to represent all annotators’ labels per sample $\\\\langle y_{i1}, \\\\dots, y_{i\\\\vert A \\\\vert} \\\\rangle$, with a shared MLP layer and then outputs are aggregated.\\nMulti-task: Similar to multi-label, but each annotator’s prediction head is learned from a separated MLP layer, such that we allocate extra compute to learn the difference among annotators.\\n\\nExperiment results on the GHC (Gab Hate Corpus) dataset showed that the multi-task model achieves the best F1 score and also can naturally provide prediction uncertainty estimation, correlated with annotation disagreement.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of different architectures for modeling multiple annotators' labels. (Image source: Davani et al. 2021)\\nJury Learning (Gordon et al. 2022) mimics the jury process by modeling the different annotators’ labeling behavior conditioned on their characteristics. Starting with a dataset with labels and demographic characteristics of each labeler, we train a model to learn to predict labels made by every individual annotator, each as a potential juror. At decision time, practitioners can specify the composition of a group of jurors to determine a sampling strategy. The final decision is made by aggregating labels from jurors from multiple trials.\\n\\nFig. 7. Illustration of how jury learning works. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nThe jury learning model is a DCN (Deep & Cross network) , commonly for recommendation use case,  that is jointly trained to learn comment embedding, annotator embedding and group (annotator’s characteristics) embedding. The text content is processed by a pre-trained BERT, which is also jointly fine-tuned but for a shorter period to avoid overfitting.\\n\\nFig. 8. DCN model architecture for jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nTheir experiment runs on the toxicity diversity dataset and compares jury learning with a baseline model which is a fine-tuned BERT to predict individual annotator’s label without using metadata. Performance is measured in MAE (mean absolute error). Jury learning consistently outperforms the annotator-agnostic baseline on the full test set as well as each group segment.\\n\\nFig. 9. Experiment results comparing an annotator-agnostic baseline with jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nData Quality ↔ Model Training#\\nOnce a dataset is constructed, many methods can help identify mislabels according to the training dynamics. Note that we only focus on methods to find and exclude data points with potentially incorrect labels, not about how to train a model with noisy data.\\nInfluence Functions#\\nInfluence functions is a classic technique from robust statistics (Hampel, 1974) to measure the effect of training data points by describing how the model parameters change as we upweight a training point by an infinitesimal amount. Koh & Liang (2017) introduced the concept to be applied to deep neural networks.\\nGiven $n$ data samples in the train set, $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$ for $i =1, \\\\dots, n$, The model parameter $\\\\theta$ is optimized to minimize a loss: $\\\\hat{\\\\theta} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. The change of model parameters after we remove a single data point $z$ is denoted as $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{z_i \\\\neq z} \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. However, computing this literally for every sample is too expensive. One way to approximate this is to compute the parameter change given a small upweight $\\\\epsilon$ on $z$. By definition, the influence of upweighting $z$ by $\\\\epsilon$ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z) = \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0}=-\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta) + \\\\epsilon L(z, \\\\theta)$ and $\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\nabla^2_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$.\\nRemoving a data point $x$ is equivalent to upweighting it by $\\\\epsilon = -\\\\frac{1}{n}$ and therefore $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\approx -\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z)$.\\nThe influence of upweighting $z$ on the loss at a test point $z_\\\\text{test}$ is given by applying the chain rule:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z, z_\\\\text{test}) \\n&= \\\\frac{d \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z})}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\frac{d \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= - \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the influence function we can measure the effect of a single data point on model parameters and loss function in closed forms. It can help approximate leave-one-out retraining without actually running all the retraining. To identify mislabeled data, we can measure $\\\\mathcal{I}_\\\\text{up,loss}(z_i, z_i)$, approximating the prediction error on $z_i$ if $z_i$ is removed from the training set.\\n\\nFig. 10. Influence functions values match leave-one-out training results on 10-class MNIST. (Image source: Kohn & Liang, 2017)\\nGiven the closed form, influence functions is still hard to be scaled up because the inverse Hessian vector product is hard to compute. Grosse et al. (2023) experimented with the EK-FAC (Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature; George et al. 2018) approximation instead.\\nPrediction Changes during Training#\\nAnother branch of methods are to track the changes of model prediction during training to identify cases which seem hard to be learned. Data Maps (Swayamdipta et al. 2020) tracks two attributes of model behavior dynamics during training to analyze the quality of dataset:\\n\\nConfidence: The model’s confidence in the true label, defined as the mean model probability of the true label across epochs. They also used a coarse-grained metric, “correctness”, defined as the fraction of times when the model predicts the correct label across epochs.\\nVariability: The variation of the confidence, defined as the standard deviation of model probability of the true label across epochs.\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Data map for SNLI training set, based on a RoBERTa classifier. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more likely to be mislabeled. They ran an experiment on WinoGrande dataset with 1% flipped label data. After retraining, flipped instances move to the lower confidence and slightly higher variability regions, indicating that the hard-to-learn regions contains mislabeled samples. Given this, we can train a classifier on equal numbers of label flipped and clean samples using only the confidence score (unsure why the paper didn’t use both confidence and variability as features). This simple noise classifier then can be used on the original dataset to identify potentially mislabeled instances.\\n\\nFig. 12. Data points originally with high confidence and low variability scores moved to low confidence, slightly higher variability regions after labels get flipped. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHowever, we should not consider all hard-to-learn samples to be incorrect. In fact, the paper hypothesizes that ambiguous (high variability) and hard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more informative for learning. Experiments showed that they are good for OOD generalization, giving better results on OOD eval, even in comparison to 100% training set.\\nTo investigate whether neural networks have a tendency to forget previously learned information, Toneva et al. (2019) designed an experiment: They track the model prediction for each sample during the training process and count the transitions for each sample from being classified correctly to incorrectly or vice-versa. Then samples can be categorized accordingly,\\n\\nForgettable (redundant) samples: If the class label changes across training epochs.\\nUnforgettable samples: If the class label assignment is consistent across training epochs. Those samples are never forgotten once learned.\\n\\nThey found that there are a large number of unforgettable examples that are never forgotten once learnt. Examples with noisy labels or images with “uncommon” features (visually complicated to classify) are among the most forgotten examples. The experiments empirically validated that unforgettable examples can be safely removed without compromising model performance.\\nIn the implementation, the forgetting event is only counted when a sample is included in the current training batch; that is, they compute forgetting across presentations of the same example in subsequent mini-batches. The number of forgetting events per sample is quite stable across different seeds and forgettable examples have a small tendency to be first-time learned later in the training. The forgetting events are also found to be transferable throughout the training period and between architectures.\\nPleiss, et al. (2020) developed a method named AUM (Area under the Margin) to spot wrong labels based on such an assumption: Say, a BIRD image is mistakenly marked as DOG. The gradient update would encourage generalization from other BIRD images to this BIRD image, while the DOG label provides an incorrect supervised signal to encourage the update to go another way. Hence, there exists tension between generalization and (wrong) prediction in gradient update signals.\\nGiven a classification dataset $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}$, let $z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ be the logit corresponding to class $i$ at epoch $t$. The margin at epoch $t$ is the difference between the assigned logit and the next largest logit:\\n\\n$$\\nM^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = z_y^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\max_{i \\\\neq y} z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{AUM}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^T_{t=1} M^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)\\n$$\\n\\nA negative margin indicates a wrong prediction and a large positive margin suggests high confidence in a correct prediction. The hypothesis is that mislabeled samples would have a smaller margin than correct samples due to the tension of generalization via SGD triggered by other samples.\\nIn order to determine the threshold, they insert fake data, named “threshold samples”, to determine the threshold:\\n\\nCreate a subset of threshold samples $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}$.  If there are $N$ training samples for $C$ classes, we randomly sample $N/(C+1)$ samples and switch all their labels to a fake new class $C+1$.\\nMerge threshold samples into the original dataset: $\\\\mathcal{D}’ = { (\\\\mathbf{x}, C+1): \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}} \\\\cup (\\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr})$;\\nTrain the model on $\\\\mathcal{D}’$ and measure AUM of all the data;\\nCompute the threshold $\\\\alpha$ as the 99th percentile of AUM of threshold samples;\\nIdentify mislabeled data using $\\\\alpha$ a threshold: ${(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}: \\\\text{AUM}_{\\\\mathbf{x}, y} \\\\leq \\\\alpha}$\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. How the AUM of threshold samples help separate out mislabeled samples. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\n\\nFig. 14. Test error on CIFAR 10/100 with randomly mislabeled samples, comparing different methods for data filter or noisy data training. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\nNoisy Cross-Validation#\\nThe NCV (Noisy Cross-Validation) method (Chen et al. 2019) divides the dataset into half at random, and then identifies data samples as “clean” if its label matches the predicted label provided by the model that is only trained on the other half of the dataset. Clean samples are expected to be more trustworthy. INCV (Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation) runs NCV iteratively where more clean samples are added into the trusted candidate set $\\\\mathcal{C}$ and more noisy samples are removed.\\n\\nFig. 15.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \\\"dark\\\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Most of the task-specific labeled data comes from human annotation, such as classification task or RLHF labeling (which can be constructed as classification format) for LLM alignment training. Lots of ML techniques in the post can help with data quality, but fundamentally human data collection involves attention to details and careful execution. The community knows the value of high quality data, but somehow we have this subtle impression that “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work” (Sambasivan et al. 2021).\\n\\nFig. 1. Two directions to approach high data quality.\\nHuman Raters ↔ Data Quality#\\nCollecting human data involve a set of operation steps and every step contributes to the data quality:\\n\\nTask design: Design task workflow to improve clarity and reduce complexity. Detailed guidelines are helpful but very long and complicated guidelines demand a decent amount of training to be useful.\\nSelect and train a pool of raters: Select annotators with matched skillset and consistency. Training sessions are necessary. After onboarding, regular feedback and calibration sessions are also needed.\\nCollect and aggregate data. This is the stage where more ML techniques can be applied to clean, filter and smartly aggregate data to identify the true labels.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. Quality assurance refers to a set of actions that allow one to improve quality by acting on the quality attributes identified in the quality model. (Image source: Daniel et al. 2018)\\nThe Wisdom of the Crowd#\\nVox populi (originally “Vox populi, vox Dei”), a Latin phrase, means the voice of people. A short paper named was the same name was published in 1907 on Nature. It tracked an event at an annual exhibition where a fat ox was selected and people would guess the weight of the ox in order to win a prize if the guess is close to the real number. The middlemost estimate was treated as “the vox populi” and ended up being very close to the true value. The author concluded “This result is, I think, more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.” This is probably the earliest mention of how crowdsourcing (“the wisdom of the crowd”) would work out.\\nAlmost 100 years later, Callison-Burch (2009) did an early study on using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to run non-expert human evaluation on Machine Translation (MT) tasks and even to rely on non-experts to create new gold reference translations. The setup for human evaluation was simple: Each turker is shown a source sentence, a reference translation, and 5 translations from 5 MT systems. They are asked to rank 5 translations from best to worst. Each task is completed by 5 turkers.\\nUnsurprisingly, there are spammers producing low quality annotation to only optimize the volume. So when measuring the agreement between experts and non-experts, different weighting schemes need to be applied to downweight the contribution of spammers: (1) “weighted by experts”: using agreement rate with experts on a gold set of 10 examples; (2) “weighted by non-experts”: relying on agreement rate with the rest of turkers on the whole dataset.\\nIn a harder task, non-expert human annotators were asked to create new gold reference translations. Callison-Burch designed the task in two stages, where the first stage created new translations with reference to MT outputs and the second one filtered translations that may seem to be gerated by a MT system. The correlation between experts’ and crowdsourced translations is higher than that between expert and MT system outputs.\\n\\nFig. 3. (Left) The agreement rate is measured by comparing each pair of translation sentences (\\\"A > B\\\", \\\"A=B\\\", \\\"A < B\\\") and thus chance agreement is 1/3. The upper bound is set by the expert-expert agreement rate. (Right) Comparison of BLEU score between translations from different sources. LCD (Linguistic Data Consortium) translators provide expert translations. (Image source: Callison-Burch 2009)\\nRater Agreement#\\nWe often think of annotation as targeting a single ground truth and try to evaluate quality against one gold answer with consistent standards. A common practice for finding reliable ground truth labels is to collect multiple labels from multiple raters. Assuming that each rater performs at a different level of quality, we can use a weighted average of annotations but weighted by a proficiency score. This score is often approximated by how often one rater agrees with others.\\nMajority Voting: Taking the majority vote is the simplest way of aggregation, equivalent to taking the mode of a set of labels. In this setting, every annotator is contributing equally.\\nRaw agreement (Tratz & Hovy, 2010): Raw agreement counts the percentage of other people agreeing with them. This is indirectly correlated to majority vote, because all members of the majority class are expected to get higher inter-annotator agreement rate.\\nCohen’s Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977): Cohen’s kappa measures the inter-rater agreement in the form of $\\\\kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_c)$, where $p_o$ is the raw agreement rate and $p_e$ is the agreement by chance. Cohen’s kappa has a correction term for agreeing by chance, but this correction may be overestimated if one label is more prevalent.\\nProbabilistic Graph Modeling: There is a body of work relying on probabilistic graph modeling to model different factors within annotation decisions, e.g. difficulty of the task, task latent topics, rater bias, rater confidence, and then predict the true labels accordingly. Zheng et al. (2017)  compared 17 algorithms on truth inference in crowdsourcing and most of them are probabilistic graph models.\\n\\nMACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation; Hovy et al. 2013) is an early example of using graph modeling to estimate the likelihood of someone acting like a “spammer” by providing random labels. Unsurprisingly in cases when the incentive is misaligned, some annotators may behave as “spammers” to optimize the volume of tasks completed for higher pay. The goal of MACE is to identify spammers. Given a task $i$ and an annotator $j$, $T_i$ is the true label, $A_{ij}$ is the assigned label and $S_{ij}$ models the probability of annotator $j$ spamming. Then the generative process can be represented as belows. The parameter $\\\\theta_j$ defines the trustworthiness of the annotator $j$ (probability of not spamming) and the parameter $\\\\xi_j$  defines how an annotator behaves when they are spamming.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n& \\\\text{for } i = 1 \\\\dots N : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad T_i \\\\sim \\\\text{Uniform} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\text{for } j = 1 \\\\dots M : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad S_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(1 - \\\\theta_j) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{if } S_{ij} = 0 : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} = T_i \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{else } : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Multinomial}(\\\\xi_j) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can learn $\\\\theta, \\\\xi$ to maximize the observed data, in the form of the marginal data likelihood, where $A$ is the matrix of annotations, $S$ is the matrix of competence indicators and $T$ is the matrix of true labels:\\n\\n$$\\nP(A; \\\\theta, \\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{T, S} \\\\big[ \\\\prod_{i=1}^N P(T_i) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{j=1}^M P(S_{ij}; \\\\theta_j) \\\\cdot P(A_{ij} \\\\vert S_{ij}, T_i; \\\\xi_j) \\\\big]\\n$$\\n\\nEither EM (Expectation–maximization) or VB (Variational Bayes) can be applied to maximize the above marginal likelihood. During EM optimization, at M-step, a fixed value $\\\\delta$ is added to the fractional counts before normalizing. During VB training, they applied symmetric Beta priors on $\\\\theta_j$  and symmetric Dirichlet priors on $\\\\xi_j$. When recovering the correct answers, we can take majority vote weighted by the annotators’ $\\\\theta$ estimates.\\nRater Disagreement & Two Paradigms#\\nThe aggregation process described above depends on an assumption that there exists one underlying gold answer and thus we can evaluate annotators’ performance accordingly. However, in many topics, especially in safety, social, or cultural areas, people can disagree and often this disagreement is valid and then it comes down to how much we want to apply a strict rule versus embracing diversity.\\nAroyo & Welty (2015) discussed a set of “myths” in the practice of human annotation collection and found all of them somewhat inaccurate, key findings including:\\n\\nOften there is more than one correct interpretation for some samples. We need diverse perspectives via e.g. having multiple people to review annotation quality.\\nDisagreement is not always bad. We should reduce disagreements caused by errors or poorly designed process but other disagreements can give us rich information.\\n\\nIf it is caused by a task not well defined, we should enhance the instruction. However, a more detailed guideline does not resolve innate diversity among opinions.\\n\\n\\nExperts may not always be better than lay people, but they would have a big gap in terms of considering what’s important.\\nGround truth annotations can change in time, especially those related to timely events or news.\\n\\nLater, Rottger et al. (2021) formulated the difference into two contrasting paradigms for data annotation for subjective NLP tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDescriptive\\nPrescriptive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinition\\nEncourage annotator subjectivity, trying to model many beliefs.\\nDiscourage annotator subjectivity, trying to consistently apply one belief.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n- Can help to identify which entries are more subjective;- Embrace diversity\\n- More aligned with standard NLP setup. - Easier to do QC by measuring disagreement or doing label aggregation.\\n\\n\\nCons\\n- Metrics like rater disagreement cannot be used to measure data quality or annotator performance; - Cannot be used for training models that are optimized for outputting one preset behavior.\\n- Expensive and challenging to create high-quality annotation guidelines, which can never be perfect, in practice;- Training annotators to get familiar with guideline in order to apply it properly is also challenging;- Cannot capture an interpretable diversity of beliefs or consistently encode one specific belief.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe descriptive paradigm allows us to understand a number of important effects as well as to account for different perspectives. For example, annotator identity (e.g. African American, LGBTQ) is found to be a statistically significant factor in how they would label identify-related content as toxic (Goyal et al. 2022). Topics can be another main driver for diverse opinions. Wang et al. (2023) studied the human evaluation process of safety of an AI conversation system and compared results between labels by Trust & Safety (T&S) professionals and crowdsourcing annotators. They intentionally collected rich metadata associated with crowd annotators like demographic or behavior information. Comparing T&S expert labels and crowd annotations, they found that agreement rates vary across semantic topics and the level of severity:\\n\\nAgreement rate differs a lot across different topics; ranging from 0.96 on violence/gory to 0.25 on personal topics.\\nAgreement rates are higher on “extreme” and “benign” conversations, given four label options marking “benign”, “debatable”, “moderate” to “extreme”.\\n\\n\\nFig. 4. Correlations between non-expert and expert annotations vary a lot across topics. (Image source: Wang et al. 2023)\\nZhang et al. (2023) proposed a taxonomy of rater disagreement to analyze the root causes. Among the listed causes, disagreement due to stochastic errors or inconsistency on the individual level should be avoided. In cases when a rater gives different labels to the same task when asked multiple times, some of those are most likely caused by human errors. Based on this intuition, the disagreement deconvolution method (Gordon et al. 2021) disentangles stable opinions from errors by anchoring each individual’s opinion to their own primary label and thus encouraging intra-rater consistency.\\n\\nFig. 5. A taxonomy of causes for rater disagreement. (Image source: Zhang et al. 2023)\\nDisagreement deconvolution relies on probabilistic graph modeling:\\n\\nEstimate how often an annotator returns non-primary labels, $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nPer sample, get an adjusted label distribution $p^*$ of primary labels based on $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nSample from $p^*$ as a new test set.\\nMeasure performance metrics against the new test set.\\n\\nGiven $C$-category classification, the sampling process of the generative model is stated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ny^*\\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C], p^*(y\\\\mid x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny_\\\\text{other}\\\\mid y^* &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C]\\\\setminus\\\\{y^*\\\\}, \\\\frac{1}{C-1}) \\\\\\\\\\nz_\\\\text{flip} \\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(p_\\\\text{flip}(x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny\\\\mid y^*, y_\\\\text{other}, z_\\\\text{flip} &= y^* (1 - z_\\\\text{flip}) + y_\\\\text{other} z_\\\\text{flip}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nGiven the true $p(y\\\\mid x)$ and $p_\\\\text{flip}$ that can be estimated from the data, we would update the label distribution of primary labels:\\n\\n$$\\np^*(y\\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{p(y\\\\mid x) - \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C-1}}{1 - \\\\frac{C \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C - 1}}\\n$$\\n\\nA new test set sampled from $p^*(y \\\\mid x)$ represents the primary labels with individual inconsistency noise removed. It can be used for evaluation, as a noise-free test set.\\nTo capture systematic disagreement among annotators when learning to predict labels, Davani et al. (2021) experimented with a multi-annotator model where predicting each annotator’s labels is treated as one sub-task. Say, the classification task is defined on an annotated dataset $D=(X, A, Y)$, where $X$ is the text instances, $A$ is the set of annotators and $Y$ is the annotation matrix, $y_{ij} \\\\in Y$ represents a binary label assigned by $a_j \\\\in A$ to the sample $x_i \\\\in X$. The majority vote for $x_i$ is denoted as $\\\\bar{y}_{i,}$. The experiment is to train a classification head on top of a pre-trained BERT model and compares 4 setups:\\n\\nBaseline: Directly predict the majority vote $\\\\bar{y}_i$, not using the full annotation matrix $Y$.\\nEnsemble: Train one model per annotator separately to predict $y_{ij}$ and then the results are aggregated by majority vote.\\nMulti-label: Learn to predict $\\\\vert A \\\\vert$ labels to represent all annotators’ labels per sample $\\\\langle y_{i1}, \\\\dots, y_{i\\\\vert A \\\\vert} \\\\rangle$, with a shared MLP layer and then outputs are aggregated.\\nMulti-task: Similar to multi-label, but each annotator’s prediction head is learned from a separated MLP layer, such that we allocate extra compute to learn the difference among annotators.\\n\\nExperiment results on the GHC (Gab Hate Corpus) dataset showed that the multi-task model achieves the best F1 score and also can naturally provide prediction uncertainty estimation, correlated with annotation disagreement.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of different architectures for modeling multiple annotators' labels. (Image source: Davani et al. 2021)\\nJury Learning (Gordon et al. 2022) mimics the jury process by modeling the different annotators’ labeling behavior conditioned on their characteristics. Starting with a dataset with labels and demographic characteristics of each labeler, we train a model to learn to predict labels made by every individual annotator, each as a potential juror. At decision time, practitioners can specify the composition of a group of jurors to determine a sampling strategy. The final decision is made by aggregating labels from jurors from multiple trials.\\n\\nFig. 7. Illustration of how jury learning works. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nThe jury learning model is a DCN (Deep & Cross network) , commonly for recommendation use case,  that is jointly trained to learn comment embedding, annotator embedding and group (annotator’s characteristics) embedding. The text content is processed by a pre-trained BERT, which is also jointly fine-tuned but for a shorter period to avoid overfitting.\\n\\nFig. 8. DCN model architecture for jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nTheir experiment runs on the toxicity diversity dataset and compares jury learning with a baseline model which is a fine-tuned BERT to predict individual annotator’s label without using metadata. Performance is measured in MAE (mean absolute error). Jury learning consistently outperforms the annotator-agnostic baseline on the full test set as well as each group segment.\\n\\nFig. 9. Experiment results comparing an annotator-agnostic baseline with jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nData Quality ↔ Model Training#\\nOnce a dataset is constructed, many methods can help identify mislabels according to the training dynamics. Note that we only focus on methods to find and exclude data points with potentially incorrect labels, not about how to train a model with noisy data.\\nInfluence Functions#\\nInfluence functions is a classic technique from robust statistics (Hampel, 1974) to measure the effect of training data points by describing how the model parameters change as we upweight a training point by an infinitesimal amount. Koh & Liang (2017) introduced the concept to be applied to deep neural networks.\\nGiven $n$ data samples in the train set, $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$ for $i =1, \\\\dots, n$, The model parameter $\\\\theta$ is optimized to minimize a loss: $\\\\hat{\\\\theta} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. The change of model parameters after we remove a single data point $z$ is denoted as $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{z_i \\\\neq z} \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. However, computing this literally for every sample is too expensive. One way to approximate this is to compute the parameter change given a small upweight $\\\\epsilon$ on $z$. By definition, the influence of upweighting $z$ by $\\\\epsilon$ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z) = \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0}=-\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta) + \\\\epsilon L(z, \\\\theta)$ and $\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\nabla^2_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$.\\nRemoving a data point $x$ is equivalent to upweighting it by $\\\\epsilon = -\\\\frac{1}{n}$ and therefore $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\approx -\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z)$.\\nThe influence of upweighting $z$ on the loss at a test point $z_\\\\text{test}$ is given by applying the chain rule:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z, z_\\\\text{test}) \\n&= \\\\frac{d \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z})}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\frac{d \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= - \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the influence function we can measure the effect of a single data point on model parameters and loss function in closed forms. It can help approximate leave-one-out retraining without actually running all the retraining. To identify mislabeled data, we can measure $\\\\mathcal{I}_\\\\text{up,loss}(z_i, z_i)$, approximating the prediction error on $z_i$ if $z_i$ is removed from the training set.\\n\\nFig. 10. Influence functions values match leave-one-out training results on 10-class MNIST. (Image source: Kohn & Liang, 2017)\\nGiven the closed form, influence functions is still hard to be scaled up because the inverse Hessian vector product is hard to compute. Grosse et al. (2023) experimented with the EK-FAC (Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature; George et al. 2018) approximation instead.\\nPrediction Changes during Training#\\nAnother branch of methods are to track the changes of model prediction during training to identify cases which seem hard to be learned. Data Maps (Swayamdipta et al. 2020) tracks two attributes of model behavior dynamics during training to analyze the quality of dataset:\\n\\nConfidence: The model’s confidence in the true label, defined as the mean model probability of the true label across epochs. They also used a coarse-grained metric, “correctness”, defined as the fraction of times when the model predicts the correct label across epochs.\\nVariability: The variation of the confidence, defined as the standard deviation of model probability of the true label across epochs.\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Data map for SNLI training set, based on a RoBERTa classifier. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more likely to be mislabeled. They ran an experiment on WinoGrande dataset with 1% flipped label data. After retraining, flipped instances move to the lower confidence and slightly higher variability regions, indicating that the hard-to-learn regions contains mislabeled samples. Given this, we can train a classifier on equal numbers of label flipped and clean samples using only the confidence score (unsure why the paper didn’t use both confidence and variability as features). This simple noise classifier then can be used on the original dataset to identify potentially mislabeled instances.\\n\\nFig. 12. Data points originally with high confidence and low variability scores moved to low confidence, slightly higher variability regions after labels get flipped. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHowever, we should not consider all hard-to-learn samples to be incorrect. In fact, the paper hypothesizes that ambiguous (high variability) and hard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more informative for learning. Experiments showed that they are good for OOD generalization, giving better results on OOD eval, even in comparison to 100% training set.\\nTo investigate whether neural networks have a tendency to forget previously learned information, Toneva et al. (2019) designed an experiment: They track the model prediction for each sample during the training process and count the transitions for each sample from being classified correctly to incorrectly or vice-versa. Then samples can be categorized accordingly,\\n\\nForgettable (redundant) samples: If the class label changes across training epochs.\\nUnforgettable samples: If the class label assignment is consistent across training epochs. Those samples are never forgotten once learned.\\n\\nThey found that there are a large number of unforgettable examples that are never forgotten once learnt. Examples with noisy labels or images with “uncommon” features (visually complicated to classify) are among the most forgotten examples. The experiments empirically validated that unforgettable examples can be safely removed without compromising model performance.\\nIn the implementation, the forgetting event is only counted when a sample is included in the current training batch; that is, they compute forgetting across presentations of the same example in subsequent mini-batches. The number of forgetting events per sample is quite stable across different seeds and forgettable examples have a small tendency to be first-time learned later in the training. The forgetting events are also found to be transferable throughout the training period and between architectures.\\nPleiss, et al. (2020) developed a method named AUM (Area under the Margin) to spot wrong labels based on such an assumption: Say, a BIRD image is mistakenly marked as DOG. The gradient update would encourage generalization from other BIRD images to this BIRD image, while the DOG label provides an incorrect supervised signal to encourage the update to go another way. Hence, there exists tension between generalization and (wrong) prediction in gradient update signals.\\nGiven a classification dataset $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}$, let $z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ be the logit corresponding to class $i$ at epoch $t$. The margin at epoch $t$ is the difference between the assigned logit and the next largest logit:\\n\\n$$\\nM^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = z_y^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\max_{i \\\\neq y} z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{AUM}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^T_{t=1} M^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)\\n$$\\n\\nA negative margin indicates a wrong prediction and a large positive margin suggests high confidence in a correct prediction. The hypothesis is that mislabeled samples would have a smaller margin than correct samples due to the tension of generalization via SGD triggered by other samples.\\nIn order to determine the threshold, they insert fake data, named “threshold samples”, to determine the threshold:\\n\\nCreate a subset of threshold samples $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}$.  If there are $N$ training samples for $C$ classes, we randomly sample $N/(C+1)$ samples and switch all their labels to a fake new class $C+1$.\\nMerge threshold samples into the original dataset: $\\\\mathcal{D}’ = { (\\\\mathbf{x}, C+1): \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}} \\\\cup (\\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr})$;\\nTrain the model on $\\\\mathcal{D}’$ and measure AUM of all the data;\\nCompute the threshold $\\\\alpha$ as the 99th percentile of AUM of threshold samples;\\nIdentify mislabeled data using $\\\\alpha$ a threshold: ${(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}: \\\\text{AUM}_{\\\\mathbf{x}, y} \\\\leq \\\\alpha}$\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. How the AUM of threshold samples help separate out mislabeled samples. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\n\\nFig. 14. Test error on CIFAR 10/100 with randomly mislabeled samples, comparing different methods for data filter or noisy data training. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\nNoisy Cross-Validation#\\nThe NCV (Noisy Cross-Validation) method (Chen et al. 2019) divides the dataset into half at random, and then identifies data samples as “clean” if its label matches the predicted label provided by the model that is only trained on the other half of the dataset. Clean samples are expected to be more trustworthy. INCV (Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation) runs NCV iteratively where more clean samples are added into the trusted candidate set $\\\\mathcal{C}$ and more noisy samples are removed.\\n\\nFig. 15.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \\\"dark\\\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The GPT-Engineer is instructed to think over a list of smaller components to build and ask for user input to clarify questions as needed.\\nHere are a sample conversation for task clarification sent to OpenAI ChatCompletion endpoint used by GPT-Engineer. The user inputs are wrapped in {{user input text}}.\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"You will read instructions and not carry them out, only seek to clarify them.\\\\nSpecifically you will first summarise a list of super short bullets of areas that need clarification.\\\\nThen you will pick one clarifying question, and wait for an answer from the user.\\\\n\\\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"We are writing {{a Super Mario game in python.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Most of the task-specific labeled data comes from human annotation, such as classification task or RLHF labeling (which can be constructed as classification format) for LLM alignment training. Lots of ML techniques in the post can help with data quality, but fundamentally human data collection involves attention to details and careful execution. The community knows the value of high quality data, but somehow we have this subtle impression that “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work” (Sambasivan et al. 2021).\\n\\nFig. 1. Two directions to approach high data quality.\\nHuman Raters ↔ Data Quality#\\nCollecting human data involve a set of operation steps and every step contributes to the data quality:\\n\\nTask design: Design task workflow to improve clarity and reduce complexity. Detailed guidelines are helpful but very long and complicated guidelines demand a decent amount of training to be useful.\\nSelect and train a pool of raters: Select annotators with matched skillset and consistency. Training sessions are necessary. After onboarding, regular feedback and calibration sessions are also needed.\\nCollect and aggregate data. This is the stage where more ML techniques can be applied to clean, filter and smartly aggregate data to identify the true labels.\\n\\n\\nFig. 2. Quality assurance refers to a set of actions that allow one to improve quality by acting on the quality attributes identified in the quality model. (Image source: Daniel et al. 2018)\\nThe Wisdom of the Crowd#\\nVox populi (originally “Vox populi, vox Dei”), a Latin phrase, means the voice of people. A short paper named was the same name was published in 1907 on Nature. It tracked an event at an annual exhibition where a fat ox was selected and people would guess the weight of the ox in order to win a prize if the guess is close to the real number. The middlemost estimate was treated as “the vox populi” and ended up being very close to the true value. The author concluded “This result is, I think, more creditable to the trustworthiness of a democratic judgment than might have been expected.” This is probably the earliest mention of how crowdsourcing (“the wisdom of the crowd”) would work out.\\nAlmost 100 years later, Callison-Burch (2009) did an early study on using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to run non-expert human evaluation on Machine Translation (MT) tasks and even to rely on non-experts to create new gold reference translations. The setup for human evaluation was simple: Each turker is shown a source sentence, a reference translation, and 5 translations from 5 MT systems. They are asked to rank 5 translations from best to worst. Each task is completed by 5 turkers.\\nUnsurprisingly, there are spammers producing low quality annotation to only optimize the volume. So when measuring the agreement between experts and non-experts, different weighting schemes need to be applied to downweight the contribution of spammers: (1) “weighted by experts”: using agreement rate with experts on a gold set of 10 examples; (2) “weighted by non-experts”: relying on agreement rate with the rest of turkers on the whole dataset.\\nIn a harder task, non-expert human annotators were asked to create new gold reference translations. Callison-Burch designed the task in two stages, where the first stage created new translations with reference to MT outputs and the second one filtered translations that may seem to be gerated by a MT system. The correlation between experts’ and crowdsourced translations is higher than that between expert and MT system outputs.\\n\\nFig. 3. (Left) The agreement rate is measured by comparing each pair of translation sentences (\\\"A > B\\\", \\\"A=B\\\", \\\"A < B\\\") and thus chance agreement is 1/3. The upper bound is set by the expert-expert agreement rate. (Right) Comparison of BLEU score between translations from different sources. LCD (Linguistic Data Consortium) translators provide expert translations. (Image source: Callison-Burch 2009)\\nRater Agreement#\\nWe often think of annotation as targeting a single ground truth and try to evaluate quality against one gold answer with consistent standards. A common practice for finding reliable ground truth labels is to collect multiple labels from multiple raters. Assuming that each rater performs at a different level of quality, we can use a weighted average of annotations but weighted by a proficiency score. This score is often approximated by how often one rater agrees with others.\\nMajority Voting: Taking the majority vote is the simplest way of aggregation, equivalent to taking the mode of a set of labels. In this setting, every annotator is contributing equally.\\nRaw agreement (Tratz & Hovy, 2010): Raw agreement counts the percentage of other people agreeing with them. This is indirectly correlated to majority vote, because all members of the majority class are expected to get higher inter-annotator agreement rate.\\nCohen’s Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977): Cohen’s kappa measures the inter-rater agreement in the form of $\\\\kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_c)$, where $p_o$ is the raw agreement rate and $p_e$ is the agreement by chance. Cohen’s kappa has a correction term for agreeing by chance, but this correction may be overestimated if one label is more prevalent.\\nProbabilistic Graph Modeling: There is a body of work relying on probabilistic graph modeling to model different factors within annotation decisions, e.g. difficulty of the task, task latent topics, rater bias, rater confidence, and then predict the true labels accordingly. Zheng et al. (2017)  compared 17 algorithms on truth inference in crowdsourcing and most of them are probabilistic graph models.\\n\\nMACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation; Hovy et al. 2013) is an early example of using graph modeling to estimate the likelihood of someone acting like a “spammer” by providing random labels. Unsurprisingly in cases when the incentive is misaligned, some annotators may behave as “spammers” to optimize the volume of tasks completed for higher pay. The goal of MACE is to identify spammers. Given a task $i$ and an annotator $j$, $T_i$ is the true label, $A_{ij}$ is the assigned label and $S_{ij}$ models the probability of annotator $j$ spamming. Then the generative process can be represented as belows. The parameter $\\\\theta_j$ defines the trustworthiness of the annotator $j$ (probability of not spamming) and the parameter $\\\\xi_j$  defines how an annotator behaves when they are spamming.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n& \\\\text{for } i = 1 \\\\dots N : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad T_i \\\\sim \\\\text{Uniform} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\text{for } j = 1 \\\\dots M : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad S_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(1 - \\\\theta_j) \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{if } S_{ij} = 0 : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} = T_i \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\text{else } : \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad A_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\text{Multinomial}(\\\\xi_j) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can learn $\\\\theta, \\\\xi$ to maximize the observed data, in the form of the marginal data likelihood, where $A$ is the matrix of annotations, $S$ is the matrix of competence indicators and $T$ is the matrix of true labels:\\n\\n$$\\nP(A; \\\\theta, \\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{T, S} \\\\big[ \\\\prod_{i=1}^N P(T_i) \\\\cdot \\\\prod_{j=1}^M P(S_{ij}; \\\\theta_j) \\\\cdot P(A_{ij} \\\\vert S_{ij}, T_i; \\\\xi_j) \\\\big]\\n$$\\n\\nEither EM (Expectation–maximization) or VB (Variational Bayes) can be applied to maximize the above marginal likelihood. During EM optimization, at M-step, a fixed value $\\\\delta$ is added to the fractional counts before normalizing. During VB training, they applied symmetric Beta priors on $\\\\theta_j$  and symmetric Dirichlet priors on $\\\\xi_j$. When recovering the correct answers, we can take majority vote weighted by the annotators’ $\\\\theta$ estimates.\\nRater Disagreement & Two Paradigms#\\nThe aggregation process described above depends on an assumption that there exists one underlying gold answer and thus we can evaluate annotators’ performance accordingly. However, in many topics, especially in safety, social, or cultural areas, people can disagree and often this disagreement is valid and then it comes down to how much we want to apply a strict rule versus embracing diversity.\\nAroyo & Welty (2015) discussed a set of “myths” in the practice of human annotation collection and found all of them somewhat inaccurate, key findings including:\\n\\nOften there is more than one correct interpretation for some samples. We need diverse perspectives via e.g. having multiple people to review annotation quality.\\nDisagreement is not always bad. We should reduce disagreements caused by errors or poorly designed process but other disagreements can give us rich information.\\n\\nIf it is caused by a task not well defined, we should enhance the instruction. However, a more detailed guideline does not resolve innate diversity among opinions.\\n\\n\\nExperts may not always be better than lay people, but they would have a big gap in terms of considering what’s important.\\nGround truth annotations can change in time, especially those related to timely events or news.\\n\\nLater, Rottger et al. (2021) formulated the difference into two contrasting paradigms for data annotation for subjective NLP tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDescriptive\\nPrescriptive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinition\\nEncourage annotator subjectivity, trying to model many beliefs.\\nDiscourage annotator subjectivity, trying to consistently apply one belief.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n- Can help to identify which entries are more subjective;- Embrace diversity\\n- More aligned with standard NLP setup. - Easier to do QC by measuring disagreement or doing label aggregation.\\n\\n\\nCons\\n- Metrics like rater disagreement cannot be used to measure data quality or annotator performance; - Cannot be used for training models that are optimized for outputting one preset behavior.\\n- Expensive and challenging to create high-quality annotation guidelines, which can never be perfect, in practice;- Training annotators to get familiar with guideline in order to apply it properly is also challenging;- Cannot capture an interpretable diversity of beliefs or consistently encode one specific belief.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe descriptive paradigm allows us to understand a number of important effects as well as to account for different perspectives. For example, annotator identity (e.g. African American, LGBTQ) is found to be a statistically significant factor in how they would label identify-related content as toxic (Goyal et al. 2022). Topics can be another main driver for diverse opinions. Wang et al. (2023) studied the human evaluation process of safety of an AI conversation system and compared results between labels by Trust & Safety (T&S) professionals and crowdsourcing annotators. They intentionally collected rich metadata associated with crowd annotators like demographic or behavior information. Comparing T&S expert labels and crowd annotations, they found that agreement rates vary across semantic topics and the level of severity:\\n\\nAgreement rate differs a lot across different topics; ranging from 0.96 on violence/gory to 0.25 on personal topics.\\nAgreement rates are higher on “extreme” and “benign” conversations, given four label options marking “benign”, “debatable”, “moderate” to “extreme”.\\n\\n\\nFig. 4. Correlations between non-expert and expert annotations vary a lot across topics. (Image source: Wang et al. 2023)\\nZhang et al. (2023) proposed a taxonomy of rater disagreement to analyze the root causes. Among the listed causes, disagreement due to stochastic errors or inconsistency on the individual level should be avoided. In cases when a rater gives different labels to the same task when asked multiple times, some of those are most likely caused by human errors. Based on this intuition, the disagreement deconvolution method (Gordon et al. 2021) disentangles stable opinions from errors by anchoring each individual’s opinion to their own primary label and thus encouraging intra-rater consistency.\\n\\nFig. 5. A taxonomy of causes for rater disagreement. (Image source: Zhang et al. 2023)\\nDisagreement deconvolution relies on probabilistic graph modeling:\\n\\nEstimate how often an annotator returns non-primary labels, $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nPer sample, get an adjusted label distribution $p^*$ of primary labels based on $p_\\\\text{flip}$\\nSample from $p^*$ as a new test set.\\nMeasure performance metrics against the new test set.\\n\\nGiven $C$-category classification, the sampling process of the generative model is stated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ny^*\\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C], p^*(y\\\\mid x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny_\\\\text{other}\\\\mid y^* &\\\\sim \\\\text{Categorial}([C]\\\\setminus\\\\{y^*\\\\}, \\\\frac{1}{C-1}) \\\\\\\\\\nz_\\\\text{flip} \\\\mid x &\\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(p_\\\\text{flip}(x)) \\\\\\\\\\ny\\\\mid y^*, y_\\\\text{other}, z_\\\\text{flip} &= y^* (1 - z_\\\\text{flip}) + y_\\\\text{other} z_\\\\text{flip}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nGiven the true $p(y\\\\mid x)$ and $p_\\\\text{flip}$ that can be estimated from the data, we would update the label distribution of primary labels:\\n\\n$$\\np^*(y\\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{p(y\\\\mid x) - \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C-1}}{1 - \\\\frac{C \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{flip}(x)}{C - 1}}\\n$$\\n\\nA new test set sampled from $p^*(y \\\\mid x)$ represents the primary labels with individual inconsistency noise removed. It can be used for evaluation, as a noise-free test set.\\nTo capture systematic disagreement among annotators when learning to predict labels, Davani et al. (2021) experimented with a multi-annotator model where predicting each annotator’s labels is treated as one sub-task. Say, the classification task is defined on an annotated dataset $D=(X, A, Y)$, where $X$ is the text instances, $A$ is the set of annotators and $Y$ is the annotation matrix, $y_{ij} \\\\in Y$ represents a binary label assigned by $a_j \\\\in A$ to the sample $x_i \\\\in X$. The majority vote for $x_i$ is denoted as $\\\\bar{y}_{i,}$. The experiment is to train a classification head on top of a pre-trained BERT model and compares 4 setups:\\n\\nBaseline: Directly predict the majority vote $\\\\bar{y}_i$, not using the full annotation matrix $Y$.\\nEnsemble: Train one model per annotator separately to predict $y_{ij}$ and then the results are aggregated by majority vote.\\nMulti-label: Learn to predict $\\\\vert A \\\\vert$ labels to represent all annotators’ labels per sample $\\\\langle y_{i1}, \\\\dots, y_{i\\\\vert A \\\\vert} \\\\rangle$, with a shared MLP layer and then outputs are aggregated.\\nMulti-task: Similar to multi-label, but each annotator’s prediction head is learned from a separated MLP layer, such that we allocate extra compute to learn the difference among annotators.\\n\\nExperiment results on the GHC (Gab Hate Corpus) dataset showed that the multi-task model achieves the best F1 score and also can naturally provide prediction uncertainty estimation, correlated with annotation disagreement.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of different architectures for modeling multiple annotators' labels. (Image source: Davani et al. 2021)\\nJury Learning (Gordon et al. 2022) mimics the jury process by modeling the different annotators’ labeling behavior conditioned on their characteristics. Starting with a dataset with labels and demographic characteristics of each labeler, we train a model to learn to predict labels made by every individual annotator, each as a potential juror. At decision time, practitioners can specify the composition of a group of jurors to determine a sampling strategy. The final decision is made by aggregating labels from jurors from multiple trials.\\n\\nFig. 7. Illustration of how jury learning works. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nThe jury learning model is a DCN (Deep & Cross network) , commonly for recommendation use case,  that is jointly trained to learn comment embedding, annotator embedding and group (annotator’s characteristics) embedding. The text content is processed by a pre-trained BERT, which is also jointly fine-tuned but for a shorter period to avoid overfitting.\\n\\nFig. 8. DCN model architecture for jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nTheir experiment runs on the toxicity diversity dataset and compares jury learning with a baseline model which is a fine-tuned BERT to predict individual annotator’s label without using metadata. Performance is measured in MAE (mean absolute error). Jury learning consistently outperforms the annotator-agnostic baseline on the full test set as well as each group segment.\\n\\nFig. 9. Experiment results comparing an annotator-agnostic baseline with jury learning. (Image source: Gordon et al. 2022)\\nData Quality ↔ Model Training#\\nOnce a dataset is constructed, many methods can help identify mislabels according to the training dynamics. Note that we only focus on methods to find and exclude data points with potentially incorrect labels, not about how to train a model with noisy data.\\nInfluence Functions#\\nInfluence functions is a classic technique from robust statistics (Hampel, 1974) to measure the effect of training data points by describing how the model parameters change as we upweight a training point by an infinitesimal amount. Koh & Liang (2017) introduced the concept to be applied to deep neural networks.\\nGiven $n$ data samples in the train set, $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$ for $i =1, \\\\dots, n$, The model parameter $\\\\theta$ is optimized to minimize a loss: $\\\\hat{\\\\theta} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. The change of model parameters after we remove a single data point $z$ is denoted as $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta}$ where $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{z_i \\\\neq z} \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta)$. However, computing this literally for every sample is too expensive. One way to approximate this is to compute the parameter change given a small upweight $\\\\epsilon$ on $z$. By definition, the influence of upweighting $z$ by $\\\\epsilon$ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z) = \\\\frac{d\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0}=-\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z} = \\\\arg\\\\min_{\\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\theta) + \\\\epsilon L(z, \\\\theta)$ and $\\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\nabla^2_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_i, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})$.\\nRemoving a data point $x$ is equivalent to upweighting it by $\\\\epsilon = -\\\\frac{1}{n}$ and therefore $\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{-z} - \\\\hat{\\\\theta} \\\\approx -\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,params}}(z)$.\\nThe influence of upweighting $z$ on the loss at a test point $z_\\\\text{test}$ is given by applying the chain rule:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathcal{I}_{\\\\text{up,loss}}(z, z_\\\\text{test}) \\n&= \\\\frac{d \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z})}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\frac{d \\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\epsilon,z}}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigg\\\\vert_{\\\\epsilon=0} \\\\\\\\\\n&= - \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z_\\\\text{test}, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} \\\\nabla_\\\\theta \\\\mathcal{L}(z, \\\\hat{\\\\theta})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nUsing the influence function we can measure the effect of a single data point on model parameters and loss function in closed forms. It can help approximate leave-one-out retraining without actually running all the retraining. To identify mislabeled data, we can measure $\\\\mathcal{I}_\\\\text{up,loss}(z_i, z_i)$, approximating the prediction error on $z_i$ if $z_i$ is removed from the training set.\\n\\nFig. 10. Influence functions values match leave-one-out training results on 10-class MNIST. (Image source: Kohn & Liang, 2017)\\nGiven the closed form, influence functions is still hard to be scaled up because the inverse Hessian vector product is hard to compute. Grosse et al. (2023) experimented with the EK-FAC (Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature; George et al. 2018) approximation instead.\\nPrediction Changes during Training#\\nAnother branch of methods are to track the changes of model prediction during training to identify cases which seem hard to be learned. Data Maps (Swayamdipta et al. 2020) tracks two attributes of model behavior dynamics during training to analyze the quality of dataset:\\n\\nConfidence: The model’s confidence in the true label, defined as the mean model probability of the true label across epochs. They also used a coarse-grained metric, “correctness”, defined as the fraction of times when the model predicts the correct label across epochs.\\nVariability: The variation of the confidence, defined as the standard deviation of model probability of the true label across epochs.\\n\\n\\nFig. 11. Data map for SNLI training set, based on a RoBERTa classifier. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more likely to be mislabeled. They ran an experiment on WinoGrande dataset with 1% flipped label data. After retraining, flipped instances move to the lower confidence and slightly higher variability regions, indicating that the hard-to-learn regions contains mislabeled samples. Given this, we can train a classifier on equal numbers of label flipped and clean samples using only the confidence score (unsure why the paper didn’t use both confidence and variability as features). This simple noise classifier then can be used on the original dataset to identify potentially mislabeled instances.\\n\\nFig. 12. Data points originally with high confidence and low variability scores moved to low confidence, slightly higher variability regions after labels get flipped. (Image source: Swayamdipta et al. 2020)\\nHowever, we should not consider all hard-to-learn samples to be incorrect. In fact, the paper hypothesizes that ambiguous (high variability) and hard-to-learn (low confidence, low variability) samples are more informative for learning. Experiments showed that they are good for OOD generalization, giving better results on OOD eval, even in comparison to 100% training set.\\nTo investigate whether neural networks have a tendency to forget previously learned information, Toneva et al. (2019) designed an experiment: They track the model prediction for each sample during the training process and count the transitions for each sample from being classified correctly to incorrectly or vice-versa. Then samples can be categorized accordingly,\\n\\nForgettable (redundant) samples: If the class label changes across training epochs.\\nUnforgettable samples: If the class label assignment is consistent across training epochs. Those samples are never forgotten once learned.\\n\\nThey found that there are a large number of unforgettable examples that are never forgotten once learnt. Examples with noisy labels or images with “uncommon” features (visually complicated to classify) are among the most forgotten examples. The experiments empirically validated that unforgettable examples can be safely removed without compromising model performance.\\nIn the implementation, the forgetting event is only counted when a sample is included in the current training batch; that is, they compute forgetting across presentations of the same example in subsequent mini-batches. The number of forgetting events per sample is quite stable across different seeds and forgettable examples have a small tendency to be first-time learned later in the training. The forgetting events are also found to be transferable throughout the training period and between architectures.\\nPleiss, et al. (2020) developed a method named AUM (Area under the Margin) to spot wrong labels based on such an assumption: Say, a BIRD image is mistakenly marked as DOG. The gradient update would encourage generalization from other BIRD images to this BIRD image, while the DOG label provides an incorrect supervised signal to encourage the update to go another way. Hence, there exists tension between generalization and (wrong) prediction in gradient update signals.\\nGiven a classification dataset $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}$, let $z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ be the logit corresponding to class $i$ at epoch $t$. The margin at epoch $t$ is the difference between the assigned logit and the next largest logit:\\n\\n$$\\nM^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = z_y^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\max_{i \\\\neq y} z^{(t)}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{AUM}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum^T_{t=1} M^{(t)}(\\\\mathbf{x}, y)\\n$$\\n\\nA negative margin indicates a wrong prediction and a large positive margin suggests high confidence in a correct prediction. The hypothesis is that mislabeled samples would have a smaller margin than correct samples due to the tension of generalization via SGD triggered by other samples.\\nIn order to determine the threshold, they insert fake data, named “threshold samples”, to determine the threshold:\\n\\nCreate a subset of threshold samples $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}$.  If there are $N$ training samples for $C$ classes, we randomly sample $N/(C+1)$ samples and switch all their labels to a fake new class $C+1$.\\nMerge threshold samples into the original dataset: $\\\\mathcal{D}’ = { (\\\\mathbf{x}, C+1): \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}} \\\\cup (\\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr})$;\\nTrain the model on $\\\\mathcal{D}’$ and measure AUM of all the data;\\nCompute the threshold $\\\\alpha$ as the 99th percentile of AUM of threshold samples;\\nIdentify mislabeled data using $\\\\alpha$ a threshold: ${(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{thr}: \\\\text{AUM}_{\\\\mathbf{x}, y} \\\\leq \\\\alpha}$\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. How the AUM of threshold samples help separate out mislabeled samples. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\n\\nFig. 14. Test error on CIFAR 10/100 with randomly mislabeled samples, comparing different methods for data filter or noisy data training. (Image source: Pleiss et al. 2020)\\nNoisy Cross-Validation#\\nThe NCV (Noisy Cross-Validation) method (Chen et al. 2019) divides the dataset into half at random, and then identifies data samples as “clean” if its label matches the predicted label provided by the model that is only trained on the other half of the dataset. Clean samples are expected to be more trustworthy. INCV (Iterative Noisy Cross-Validation) runs NCV iteratively where more clean samples are added into the trusted candidate set $\\\\mathcal{C}$ and more noisy samples are removed.\\n\\nFig. 15.
